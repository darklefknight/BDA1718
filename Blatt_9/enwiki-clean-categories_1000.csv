15110370,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15110370,Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Veszprém,"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Veszprém (, ) is an Archdiocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary. Believed to have been established in 1009 AD by King Stephen I of Hungary, as the Diocese of Veszprém, the diocese was originally a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Esztergom. In 1992, the Diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese. The Archdiocese is the Metropolitan of the Diocese of Kaposvár and the Diocese of Szombathely.          The Cathedral of Veszprém is dedicated to Saint Michael. The current archbishop is Gyula Márfi who was appointed in 1997.          The circumstances of the establishment of the episcopal see in Veszprém are still under debate. It is probable that Veszprém was the habitual residence of Bishop Bruno, who had been sent to evangelise the Magyars in 972; but it was probably only in 1009 when King Stephen I of Hungary issued the Deed of Foundation of the Diocese of Veszprém. Based on the Deed of Foundation, the territory of the Diocese of Veszprém extended over the territories of the Counties of Veszprém, Fejér, Visegrád and Kolon. The Diocese of Veszprém was suffragan to the Archdiocese of Esztergom.          When the Abbey of Pannonhalma was established in 1001, King Stephen I granted the tithes of the County of Somogy to the Abbey, but the county itself still belonged to the Diocese of Veszprém.          The diocese was linked traditionally to the queen consort. Thus, the ""ius patronatus"" of the Cathedral in Veszprém was due to not only the king of Hungary but also his wife.          Based on the tradition, the bishop of Veszprém was entitled to crown queens of Hungary, and this tradition was confirmed by an agreement between Bishop Robert of Veszprém and Archbishop János of Esztergom in April 1216.          The bishop of Veszprém became also the queen's chancellor . The first bishop of Veszprém who used the title was Bertalan, Bishop of Veszprém, and in 1269 King Béla IV confirmed that the title was connected to the bishopric.          In the year 1294, Queen Fenenna confirmed that, at that time, Dowager Queen Elizabeth had the privilege to collect the donations of the church in the Veszprém County, despite being a former queen.          On 26 October 1313, King Charles I and Bishop Stephen Kéki concluded an agreement under which the Bishop ceded the tithe of Csepel Island to the King in exchange for the County of Veszprém. The agreement was confirmed, in 1392, by King Sigismund; therefore the bishops of Veszprém became also the perpetual ispáns of Veszprém.          http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dvesz.html","['History of Christianity in Hungary', 'Roman Catholic dioceses in Hungary', 'Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Veszpr\xc3\xa9m', 'Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces in Hungary', '1009 establishments']"

AKF seeks to provide long-term solutions to problems of poverty, hunger, illiteracy and ill health in the poorest parts of South and Central Asia, Eastern and Western Africa, and the Middle East. In these regions, the needs of rural communities in mountainous, coastal and other resource-poor areas are given particular attention. The Foundation's activities often reinforce the work of other sister agencies within the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). While these agencies are guided by different mandates pertaining to their respective fields of expertise (the environment, culture, microfinance, health, education, architecture, rural development), their activities are often coordinated with one another in order to ""multiply"" the overall effect that the Network has in any given place or community. AKF also collaborates with local, national and international partners in order to bring about sustainable improvements of life in the 19 countries in which it works. The Foundation's head office is located in Geneva, Switzerland.          The Foundation concentrates its resources on selected issues in health, education, rural development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society. Seeking innovative approaches to generic problems, it tries to identify solutions that can be adapted to conditions in many different regions and replicated.          Cross-cutting issues that are also addressed by the Foundation include human resource development, community participation, and gender and development.          The Aga Khan Foundation is the principal grant-making agency for social development within the Aga Khan Development Network. Grants are normally given to local organizations interested in testing new solutions, in learning from experience and in being agents of lasting change. These organizations must share the Foundation's and Aga Khan Development Network's goals in their specific areas of focus. If no established group exists, the Foundation occasionally creates new organizations to tackle particularly important problems.          The Aga Khan provides the Foundation with regular funding for administration and new programme initiatives as well as contributions to its endowment. The Ismaili community contributes volunteer time, professional services and substantial financial resources. Other funding sources include income from investments and grants from government, institutional and private sector partners - as well as donations from individuals around the world.          One programme series funded by the Foundation was the BBC World News television series ""Architects on the Frontline"", which was about entries to the Aga Khan Award for Architecture competition, and was criticized by the media watchdog Ofcom for breaking United Kingdom broadcasting rules; viewers were not informed that the series, which praised the competition, was sponsored content.          Among other recognition for its work, the Foundation received the 2005 Award for Most Innovative Development Project from the Global Development Network for the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) in Pakistan.

34215,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34215,X-Ray Spex,"X-Ray Spex were an English punk band from London that formed in 1976.          During their first incarnation (1976–79), X-Ray Spex were “deliberate underachievers” and only managed to release five singles and one album. Nevertheless, their first single, ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"", is now acknowledged as a classic punk rock single and the album, ""Germfree Adolescents"", is widely acclaimed as a classic album of the punk rock genre.          Initially, the band featured singer Poly Styrene (born Marion Joan Elliott-Said) (alternatively spelled Marian or Marianne) on vocals, Jak Airport (Jack Stafford) on guitars, Paul Dean on bass, Paul 'B. P.' Hurding on drums, and Lora Logic (born Susan Whitby) on saxophone. This latter instrument was an atypical addition to the standard punk instrumental line-up, and became one of the group's most distinctive features. Lora played on only one of the band's records. As she was only fifteen, playing saxophone was a hobby and she left the band to complete her education.          X-Ray Spex's other distinctive musical element was Poly Styrene's voice, which has been variously described as ""effervescently discordant"" and ""powerful enough to drill holes through sheet metal"". As Mari Elliot, Poly had released a reggae single for GTO Records in 1976, ""Silly Billy"", which had not charted. Born in 1957 in Bromley, Kent, of both Somali and British parentage, Poly Styrene became the group's public face, and remains one of the most memorable front-women to emerge from the punk movement. Unorthodox in appearance, she wore thick braces on her teeth and once stated that ""I said that I wasn't a sex symbol and that if anybody tried to make me one I'd shave my head tomorrow"". She later actually did at Johnny Rotten's flat prior to a concert at Victoria Park. Mark Paytress recounts in the liner notes for the 2002 compilation, ""The Anthology"", that Jah Wobble, Rotten's longtime friend and bassist for his post-punk venture PiL, once described Styrene as a ""strange girl who often talked of hallucinating. She freaked John out."" Rotten, known more for his outspoken dislikes and disdain than for praise and admiration, said of X-Ray Spex in a retrospective punk documentary, ""Them, they came out with a sound and attitude and a whole energy—it was just not relating to anything around it—""superb"".""          Styrene was inspired to form a band by seeing the Sex Pistols in Hastings and, through their live performances, she and X-Ray Spex became one of the most talked about acts on the infant punk scene. The band played twice at the punk club The Roxy during its first 100 days. In March, the band played with The Drones and Chelsea. In April, they shared the bill with the Buzzcocks, Wire, and Johnny Moped. Their first Roxy gig was only their second live appearance. It was recorded and their anthem ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"" was included on the influential ""Live at the Roxy WC2"" album. Styrene was sixteen years old at the time of the recording. The publicity from this gig led to a ""near residency"", particularly on Sunday nights, at 'The Man in the Moon' pub, Kings Road, Chelsea, and record label interest.          In late September 1977, a studio recording of ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"" was released as a single. Today, the 45 is regarded as their most enduring artefact, both as a piece of music and as a sort of proto-grrrl catchphrase. Opening with the spoken/screamed line, ""Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard but I think, oh bondage, up yours!"", the song could be interpreted as a premonition of the riot grrrl movement a good 15 years later, although Styrene herself insists it was more intended as an anti-consumerist/anti-capitalist jingle, and was not exclusively feminist in nature.          In late 1977, Lora Logic was replaced on saxophone, first temporarily by John Glyn (who later joined Wreckless Eric's band), and then permanently by Rudi Thompson (also known as Steve Rudi).          In November 1978, the band released their debut album. With the exception of ""Identity"", which was partially based on Styrene seeing a girl slash her wrists in a club toilet, the rest of ""Germfree Adolescents"" dealt with the anti consumerist theme. Indeed, ""The Guardian"" newspaper described the album as containing ""unrivalled anti-consumerism anthems"".          X-Ray Spex played at 'Front Row Festival', a three-week event at the Hope and Anchor, Islington in late November and early December 1977. This resulted in the band's inclusion, alongside the likes of Wilko Johnson, 999, The Only Ones, the Saints, The Stranglers, and XTC, on a double album of recordings from the festival. Then, in February 1978, before the release of their second single, X-Ray Spex recorded the first of two sessions for John Peel at BBC Radio 1. Their profile was further enhanced by playing a fortnight's residency at New York's CBGB's, even though the album ""Germ Free Adolescents"" was not released in America until 1992.          On 30 April 1978, the band appeared at the Rock Against Racism gig at Victoria Park, Bow, Tower Hamlets. Also on the bill were Steel Pulse, The Clash, The Ruts, Sham 69, Generation X and Tom Robinson Band. Later in the year, to promote the album, X-Ray Spex embarked on their first, and only, full UK tour. Exhausted by touring, Poly Styrene left the band in mid 1979, though she is seen performing with the band in the 1980 film, ""D.O.A."". She released a solo album, ""Translucence"", before joining the Hare Krishna movement (as did Logic, who left the band aged 16 in 1977 to form a new group called Essential Logic).          Without Styrene, the group lost its momentum and split up. Hurding and Airport went on to form Classix Nouveaux, while Paul Dean and Rudi Thompson went on to form Agent Orange with Anthony ""Tex"" Doughty, who later become a founding member of Transvision Vamp.          The first incarnation of X-Ray Spex existed from mid-1976 to 1979, during which time they released five singles—""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"", ""Identity"", ""The Day the World Turned Day-Glo"", ""Germfree Adolescents"", and ""Highly Inflammable""—and one album, ""Germfree Adolescents"". One retrospective review described the singles as “not only riveting examples of high-energy punk, but contained provocative, thoughtful lyrics berating the urban synthetic fashions of the 70s and urging individual expression”.          The same reviewer in ""The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music"" sums up the band's 1970s contribution as “one of the most inventive, original and genuinely exciting groups to emerge during the punk era”.          In 1991 X-Ray Spex reformed for a surprise sell-out gig at the Brixton Academy where Poly appeared in a blue foam dress with an army helmet (to her regret). The group reformed again in 1995 with a line-up of Styrene, Dean and Logic to release a new album ""Conscious Consumer"". Although heralded as the first in a trilogy, the album was not a commercial success. Styrene later explained that touring and promotional work suffered an abrupt end when she was run over by a fire engine in central London, suffering a fractured pelvis. The following year X-Ray Spex played at the 20th Anniversary of Punk Festival in Blackpool minus Poly Styrene, overcoming her last-minute decision to withdraw by recruiting a replacement female singer named 'Poly Filla'. The band subsequently disbanded, but later releases include a compilation of the group's early records, a live album, and an anthology of all the aforementioned.          Jak Airport later worked for the BBC's Corporate and Public Relations department under his real name, Jack Stafford; he died on 13 August 2004 of cancer.          On 28 April 2008, Poly Styrene gave a performance of ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"" in front of more than 10,000 people at the Love Music Hate Racism free concert in Victoria Park, East London          Symond Lawes, working as Concrete Jungle Productions, together with Poly Styrene, produced the live show at Camden Roundhouse in 2008.          The band including original bass player Paul Dean, played what was described as a raucous comeback gig and in front of an audience of 3,000 full at The Roundhouse in London on 6 September 2008. The gig consisted of ""Germfree Adolescents"" in its entirety, with the exception of ""Plastic Bag"". A DVD and CD of the Roundhouse performance was released in November 2009 on the Year Zero Label by Future Noise Music.          Poly Styrene died of spinal and breast cancer on 25 April 2011 in East Sussex, England at the age of 53.

3786605,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3786605,Gail Ann Dorsey,"Gail Ann Dorsey (born November 20, 1962) is an American musician. With a distinguished career as a session musician, she is perhaps best known for her longtime residency in David Bowie's band, from 1995 to Bowie's death in 2016. Aside from playing bass, she occasionally has sung lead vocals according to Bowie's introduction on ""A Reality Tour"", on ""Under Pressure"", and duetted with him on others, including ""The London Boys"", ""Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)"", ""I Dig Everything"", accompanying Bowie on clarinet, and a cover of Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman"".          From 1993 to 1996, Dorsey also recorded and toured extensively with Tears for Fears, and collaborated on songwriting within the band. She appeared in several of the band's promo videos throughout this period. Her diverse range of work includes performances and/or recordings with, among others, David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz, Bryan Ferry, Boy George, the Indigo Girls, Khaled, Jane Siberry, The The, Skin, Gwen Stefani, Charlie Watts, Seal, Gang of Four, Susan Werner, ani difranco and Dar Williams.          In addition, Dorsey has released three solo albums: ""The Corporate World"" (1988), ""Rude Blue"" (1992), and ""I Used To Be..."" (2003).          Dorsey grew up in the 1970s in West Philadelphia. She played guitar from the age of nine and cites Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad, Terry Kath of Chicago, Jimi Hendrix, and Nancy Wilson of Heart as early influences. She acquired a bass shortly after her 14th birthday but didn't consider herself a bass player until she was 20. She also wrote feature-length screenplays to accompany some of her musical compositions.          Dorsey attended the California Institute of the Arts in the School of Film & VideoSchool/Live Action. She received a full scholarship with her screenplays and short Super 8mm films. Dorsey was the only female in her freshman class and the youngest female to be admitted to the Live Action department up to that point. After completing three semesters she felt unsuited for the film industry and once again turned to a career in music.          At age 22, Dorsey moved to London to pursue her musical career, where she was in a musical collaboration/band 20To with keyboard player/composer Pete Stern. Their first demos were engineered and produced by Paul ""Doc"" Stewart at Village Way Studio in Rayners Lane, north west London. Stewart was responsible for their introduction to CBS records, which led to her first recording deal. She established herself through collaborations with artists such as Boy George, Ann Pigalle, and Donny Osmond. Dorsey's first high profile job was as a guest vocalist in the original line up of The Charlie Watts Big Band (drummer for The Rolling Stones) and its 1985 premiere at London's famous West End jazz club, Ronnie Scott's. A crucial point for Dorsey’s burgeoning solo career was her appearance on ""The Tube"", a hit British music television weekly hosted by Jools Holland and Paula Yates.          In December 1987, she signed with Warner Music Group in London, and in 1988 released her first solo album, ""The Corporate World"". The album was produced by bassist Nathan East of the jazz quartet Fourplay and included appearances by artists such as Eric Clapton. It received a 5-star review and was voted one of the Top 50 Albums of the Year by London's Q Magazine.          She moved to Island Records in 1991, signed by founder Chris Blackwell. In 1992, she released her second solo album entitled ""Rude Blue"", which featured trumpeter Mark Pender and trombonist Richie ""La Bamba"" (Conan O'Brien Band), Carla Azar on drums (Wendy & Lisa), Carol Steele on percussion (Bette Midler), and the infamous James Brown horn section of Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis. After almost 12 years in England, she relocated to the well-known artist community of Woodstock in upstate New York in 1994.          When her relationship with Island began to become strained, Dorsey began to concentrate on session work and in 1995 was recruited for David Bowie´s Outside Tour. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s and into the 21st century she performed and recorded with artists such as Gang Of Four, Louise Goffin, world music stars Rachid Taha, Faudel, and Khaled (""1, 2, 3 Soleils""), Sophie B. Hawkins, Tears For Fears, The The, The Indigo Girls, Canadian artist Jane Siberry, Jeffrey Gaines, Italian blues man Zucchero, Dar Williams, Catie Curtis, Toshi Reagon, Joan Osborne, The B-52s, and Michael Hutchence of INXS.          Gail Ann Dorsey is best known for her contribution to the David Bowie band. After the Outside Tour she provided vocals and bass for ""Earthling"" (1997), ""Heathen"" (2002), ""Reality"" (2003) and ""The Next Day"" (2013). She recorded ""Planet of Dreams"", a duet with Bowie on the 1997 EMI UK benefit CD release,"" Long Live Tibet"", as well as several other live recordings and videos. She has been on board for the last six tours and performed with David Bowie at ""The Concert For New York"" at Madison Square Garden. About a decade after ""Rude Blue"", Gail Ann Dorsey released her third solo album in 2003. The album entitled ""I Used To Be"" is a collection of previously unreleased material spanning the past 18 years of Dorsey's songwriting archives. She writes all songs with the exception of a few collaborators, namely Roland Orzabal and singer-songwriter Kristen Hall."" I Used To Be"" was produced by Dorsey and engineer/producer Brandon Mason (Joan Baez, Heather Nova), with long-time friend and fellow bassist, Sara Lee as executive producer.          Dorsey's musical style spans broadly and includes rock, funk, country, and pop influences. She describes her current sound as a present-day version of the AM/FM radio tunes that left a mark on her music such as The Fifth Dimension, Olivia Newton-John, Bread and the Wilson sisters, and Heart. When asked to describe her sound in one word she says ""Black-arach...but that's maybe how I feel most days. Sometimes you can never tell what vehicle is required to deliver the message until it tells you. I don't want to limit myself to anything. I just want to maintain honesty and substance in the work. That is my responsibility to the music and the audience.""

2017032,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017032,Hong Kong Federation of Students,"The Hong Kong Federation of Students (, HKFS) is a student organisation formed by the student unions of four higher institutions in Hong Kong. The purpose of the HKFS is to promote student movements and to enhance students’ engagement in society.          It is currently led by Nathan Law Kwun-chung, the secretary-general of the federation.          The Council (代表會) is formed by the representatives from the student unions of the universities who are elected by university students. The standing committee is appointed by the Council.          The federation was founded in May 1958. Their purpose at that time was to promote students' participation in social affairs by representing students. There were originally four member university student unions, in its first term, the committee was made up of seven students.          In the Senkaku Islands dispute, at the time of the transfer of the administration of the Senkaku/Diaoyutai Islands from the United States to Japan in 1971, some Hong Kong students established the Hong Kong Action Committee in Defence of Diaoyutai Islands (香港保衛釣魚台行動委員會) on 14 February. The committee held demonstrations in front of the Japanese consulate in Hong Kong this led to twenty-one people being arrested, seven of whom were university students. On 17 April, the Hong Kong University Students' Union held a peaceful demonstration in which about 1,000 students took part however on 7 July, the federation held a larger-scale demonstration. As the federation was still an illegal organization at that time, some students were arrested by the Royal Hong Kong Police. On 13 May 1975, the federation held its last protest on the issue.          During 1975 to 1976, the standing committee of the federation voiced their support of the Cultural Revolution instigated by the Communist Party in mainland China. Mak Chung Man, who led students to protest against the communists, was criticised by the federation as being ""against all the Chinese"", this pronouncement caused great resentment among students, and the handling of diverging opinions became the main topic in the 1976 HKFS election.          In April 1977, the Hong Kong University Students' Union suggested removal of ""anti-right wing"" from the action guide of the federation but the standing committee refused to vote. All delegates from the Hong Kong University Students' Union withdrew in protest.          In April 1979, the federation held a memorial of May Fourth Movement, which was poorly attended.          During the 1980s, the federation started to support the democratic movements in Taiwan and mainland China.          In 1981 the ""Hong Kong Standard"" revealed that the HKFS had been on a 'Red List' in a classified Standing Committee on Pressure Groups (SCOPG) report, the report described the group as ""pro-communist"".          The federation reported Shue Yan College to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in March 1983 for serious corruption, however, ICAC chose not to prosecute the college.          After 1984, the federation fully changed its direction from supporting communism to supporting democratic development.          In February 1989, about 4,000 students boycotted classes to protest against the policy of the Education Department.          During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the federation took part in the demonstrations and the strike in China. On 20 May, when the tropical cyclone signal number 8 was hoisted, thousands of students took part in a massive demonstration. After the 4 June massacre, all universities' students stopped attending classes, since then, there are memorial activities every year. In 1991, there were protests to support Wang Dan; however, the police said it was an ""illegal protest"" and gave warnings to the committees, this angered the students.          Since the 1990s, the federation has taken an interest in daily events in Hong Kong, and no longer restricts itself to the areas of education and politics.          In 2003, 2004 and 2005, the federation actively took part in the 1 July marches. In the one in 2004, the federation was the largest group present.          The federation, led by Alex Chow and Lester Shum, was a participating organisation of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, which demanded genuine democracy in future chief executive elections. Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok were occupied by suffragists for two months.          Some democratic activists criticised the federation for failing to lead the movement. Five of its member organisations held disaffiliation referenda in early 2015, and four passed, reducing the number of member organisations from eight to four. The results are as follows:          Amidst the rise of localism of Hong Kong in 2015, the Federation was absent for the first time from the Victoria Park candlelight vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre.

He is considered one of the elder statesmen of Australian literature. He is also known for short story collections and his autobiography ""Disturbing Element"".          Herbert was born Alfred Jackson in Geraldton, Western Australia, in 1901, the illegitimate son of Amy Victoria Scammell and Benjamin Francis Herbert, a Welsh-born engine driver. He was registered at birth as Alfred Jackson, son of John Jackson, auctioneer, with whom his mother had already had two children. Before writing he worked many jobs in Western Australia and Victoria; his first job was in a pharmacy at the age of fourteen. He studied pharmacy at Perth Technical College and was registered as a pharmacist on 21 May 1923 as Alfred Xavier Herbert. He moved to Melbourne, and in 1935 enrolled at the University of Melbourne to study medicine. He started his writing career writing short stories for the popular magazine and newspaper market, publishing under a range of pseudonyms, the most common being Herbert Astor.          He did not publish his first book, ""Capricornia"", until 1938. ""Capricornia"" was in part based on Herbert's experiences as Protector of Aborigines in Darwin, though it was written in London between 1930 and 1932. It won the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for Australia's Best Novel of 1939.          The 1940s and 1950s were a relatively lean time for Herbert in terms of publication. He released ""Seven Emus"" (1959). In the 1960s he published two books, before the release of ""Poor Fellow My Country"" (1975), as well as a short story collection. ""Poor Fellow My Country"" is the longest Australian novel.          Herbert was well known for his outspoken views on indigenous issues. He was a great champion of Aboriginal peoples, particularly those living in missions in Queensland and the Northern Territory. In his personal life he was considered difficult, and his wife Sadie said it was a choice between having children and looking after Xavier. Aware of his own mythology, he frustrated biographers by telling unreliable stories about his life and past.          In 1977 the artist Ray Crooke painted a ""Portrait of Xavier Herbert"" followed in 1980 by a ""Portrait of Sadie Herbert"". Professor Emeritus Laurie Hergenhan discusses the story behind the creation of these artworks, and another portrait by Crooke of Sir Zelman Cowen, in ""A Tale of Three Portraits.""

1785944,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1785944,L'Illusion Comique,"L'Illusion comique is a comedic play written by Pierre Corneille in 1636. In its use of meta-theatricality (plays-within-the-play), it is far ahead of its time. It was first performed at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1636 and published in 1639.          Corneille wrote this piece at the age of 29 and had already written seven other plays. ""L'Illusion comique"" marks a turning point in his career. This piece can be regarded as the end of an apprenticeship during which the author demonstrates his literary prowess. In this work, Corneille makes use of all theatre genres: the first act is a prologue that is inspired by the pastoral style, and the next three acts are an imperfect comedy with the farcical character Matamore at the center. The fourth and fifth acts evolve into a tragicomedy with their episodes of rivalry, imprisonment, and even death. ""L'Illusion comique"" is therefore a summary of a theatrical universe, and it is in this play that Corneille shows his mastery of theatre as a whole.          ""L'Illusion comique"" plays with the idea of theatre within the theatre and has many layers of representation:          The complex structure of the play, based on a mise en abyme and a play on appearances is designed to confuse the reader. The game of illusions is found in the Baroque idea that life is a theatre; and Corneille exploits this idea by mixing the real life of Clindor and the role that he plays. Disguise and changing identity are marks of the Baroque in this play. The grotto can also be interpreted as a metaphor for the theatre and its spectators.          The linearity of the story is broken several times, and numerous digressions interrupt actions that overlap and are often incomplete. The principal story is interlaced with many subplots. The inconsistency of the plot is reinforced by the amorous inconsistency of the characters. This instability is present again at the end when Pridamant and the reader cannot distinguish between reality and fiction.          Corneille seems to disregard the three unities of classical theatre:          ""L'Illusion comique"" was written during a period of transition from the Baroque to the Classical, and it can be seen as both a homage to the Baroque theatre as well as a satire of the same.          Although this piece is primarily Baroque, certain passages seem to follow the traditional lines of classical tragedy. In spite of the legerity of the plot concerning the lovers, the theme of death appears several times. Of course, there is the false death of Clindor which plunges the play into the atmosphere of tragedy; like Pridamant, the spectator is faced with emotions of terror and pity which are the two great theatrical sentiments according to Aristotle. However, the two passages that are the most classical in nature are the monologues of Isabelle (Act IV, scene 1) and of Clindor (Act IV, scene 7. Devastated by the judgment against her lover, Isabelle imagines her own death like the heroine of a tragedy. Moreover, she is not satisfied to follow Clindor in death; she also hopes to punish her father. As for Clindor, he uses his memory of Isabelle in order to overcome his fear of death. He exclaims: ""I die glorious because I die for you!"" For a moment, he falls back into despair, but ultimately, love allows him to transcend his thoughts and fears of death.          The Commedia dell'arte is the principal source for the new theatre of the 17th century by bringing together a popular technique with the aesthetic development of the Renaissance in Italy. The Commedia dell'arte concerns itself mostly with the verbal and physical dexterity of the actors and relies heavily on improvisation. The character of Matamore is directly borrowed from this tradition as well as the juxtaposition of characters from several social classes. Matamore can be compared to Sganarelle, the valet of Don Juan.          Pastoral theatre takes place in an idealized setting according to the ancient model of Arcadia. The first act of ""L'Illusion comique"" borrows several elements from the pastoral, including the grotto and the magician.          A tragicomedy uses characters that are relatively close to everyday life who are confronted with situations where emotions get in the way of actions. The mixture of death (tragedy) and marriage (comedy) is one manifestation of this.          The play has enjoyed renewed popularity in recent years, since Tony Kushner adapted it as ""The Illusion"".          The Comédie Française commissioned an adaptation in modern dress from the actor/director Mathieu Amalric and that film débuted on French television in 2010. Among other changes, Matamore has become the designer of a shooter video game, while the final act takes place in a night club.          Ranjit Bolt's translation was dramatized and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 25 September 2011 directed by Peter Kavanagh with original music composed and performed by Russell Taylor and Steve Cooke. The cast included: Richard Johnson as Alcandre, Michael Maloney as Clindor, John Sessions as Matamore, Hattie Morahan as Isabelle, Benjamin Whitrow as Géronte, Pip Torrens as Adraste, Rosie Fellner as Lyse, Paul Moriarty as Pridamant, Simon Bubb as Dorante and Victoria Inez-Hardy as Empress/Queen.          In 2012, a new adaptation of the play opened at Under St. Mark's in New York City. The production was adapted and directed by Kevin P. Joyce, and transposes the play from 17th century France to Turn-of-the-20th Century Louisiana, specifically the Atchafalaya Basin (Alcandre's lair), the Garden District (Isabelle's home) and a showboat (the Fifth Act). The role of Alcandre was rewritten for a woman and modeled after Marie Laveau. The production was directed by Mr. Joyce and featured Christopher Fayne as Pridamant, Rebeca Radozskowicz as Alcandre (understudied by Juanita Pearl Johnson), Matt Alford as Clindor, Alexandra Scardapane as Isabelle, Maisie Salinger as Lyse, Chris Lemieux as Matamore, Jesse Keitel as Adraste, Evan Pearson as Geronte, Andrew Meyer as Dorante/Jailer and Joshua Wise as the Page. It also featured music by PJ Rassmussen, designs by Justin West, Matsy Stintson, George Scholes Robson V, Vincent Coviello & Brian McManimon, as well as fight choreography by Brian Walters. The production received positive reviews from audiences but no reviews were publicly published due to the play's limited run.","['French plays', '1636 plays', 'Plays by Pierre Corneille']"

45223847,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45223847,List of schools and lineages of Tibetan Buddhism,"This is a list of schools and lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. It includes monastic and ngagpa lineages. It includes lineages that are entirely non-Tibetan in their current teaching membership, but which are derived from Tibetan Buddhism.          The diagram to the right shows the growth of Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The four main ones overlap markedly, such that ""about eighty percent or more of the features of the Tibetan schools are the same"". Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha. On questions of philosophy they have no fundamental differences, according to the Fourteenth Dalai Lama The Tibetan adjectival suffix ""-pa"" is translatable as ""-ist"" in English.          These first four major schools are sometimes said to constitute the Nyingma ""Old Translation"" and Sarma ""New Translation"" traditions, the latter following from the historical Kadam lineage of translations and tantric lineages. Another common but trivial differentiation is into the Yellow Hat (Gelug) and Red Hat (non-Gelug) sects, a division that mirrors the distinction between the schools involved in the Rimé movement versus the one that did not, the Gelug. The correspondences are as follows:          ""The Ancient Ones"" are the oldest Buddhist school, the original order founded by Padmasambhava and Śāntarakṣita. Whereas other schools categorize their teachings into the three yānas or ""vehicles"", Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana, the Nyingma tradition classifies its teachings into Nine Yānas, among the highest of which is Dzogchen. Terma ""treasures"" (revealed texts) are of particular significance to the Nyingma school.          “Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word”. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master Naropa via Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa and Gampopa and consists of four major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu, headed by a Karmapa, the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. There are a further eight minor sub-sects, all of which trace their root to Pagtru Kagyu and the most notable of which are the Drikung and Drukpa Lineages. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu, which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher Kalu Rinpoche, traces its history back to the Indian master Naropa via Niguma, Sukhasiddhi and Kyungpo Naljor.          The ""Grey Earth"" school represents the scholarly tradition. Headed by the Sakya Trizin, this tradition was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo (, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great lotsāwa Drogmi Shākya () and traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Virūpa. A renowned exponent, Sakya Pandita (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.          The ""Way of Virtue"" school was originally a reformist movement and is known for its emphasis on logic and debate. The order was founded in the 14th to 15th century by Je Tsongkhapa, renowned for both his scholarship and virtue. Its spiritual head is the Ganden Tripa and its temporal one the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is regarded as the embodiment of Avalokiteśvara. Successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.           The Jonang is a minor school that branched off from Sakya traditions; it was suppressed in 1650 in Gelug-controlled regions and subsequently banned and its monks and nuns converted to the Gelug school in 1658.          The Jonang re-established their religio-political center in Golok, Nakhi and Mongol areas in Kham and Amdo centered at Dzamthang Monastery and have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas and at the edges of historic Gelug influence.          However, their teachings were limited to these regions until the Rimé movement of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug schools of thought and practice. In modern times has been encouraged to grow by the 14th Dalai Lama, who installed the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu as its head.",[]

23559098,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23559098,Murray Battery,"Murray Battery () was an artillery battery located on Battery Path, beneath Government Hill in Central, Hong Kong. Named after Sir George Murray, it was built in 1841, shortly after the British took possession of Hong Kong, and served to protect the colonial government's headquarters. It was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with the Former Central Government Offices.          During the First Opium War, the British occupied Hong Kong in 1841 and one year later, the territory was ceded to them in the Treaty of Nanking. The new administration chose the site around Battery Path to build its headquarters and defences. The coastal fortification consisted of five coastal artillery positions that overlooked and guarded Victoria Harbour in 1882 (however, due to land reclamation, the site is no longer situated on the coastline). These were removed in the late 19th century, due to the military's relocation and development of artillery batteries in more obscure and outlying areas in Hong Kong Island—namely the Lei Yue Mun Fort built in 1887. Prior to 1856, Murray Battery also marked the limits of the city's street lighting; all roads east of the battery were not illuminated.          However, the site of the battery still existed until the 1950s, when the colonial government decided to redevelop the area in order to build a new headquarters building that would consolidate all government departments in one place. As a result, the battery was demolished and the new (now former) Central Government Offices (CGO) was built in its place, with construction being completed in 1959. The West Wing of the CGO now occupies the site of the battery. Today, a replica cannon located near the CGO pays tribute to Murray's Battery.","['Former buildings and structures in Hong Kong', 'Forts in Hong Kong', 'Military of Hong Kong under British rule', 'Batteries']"

30944099,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30944099,Funmate,"Funmate (also called Funmate International) was a toy company based in Japan. It was probably best known for its plastic promotional model cars made in the 1970s and 1980s. Sizes varied, but they were about 1:40 scale (four to five inches in length). The company also made a variety of other plastic toys. Later toys were made in Hong Kong.          Probably Funmate's most well-known offering was a series of Ford vehicles sealed in plastic to the sides of Procter & Gamble detergent packages for 1971 and 1972 (The Accelerator, 2008). They were marketed as ""Go Cars"" and had a spring-loaded handle with a three-inch-long narrow metal rod that slipped into a hole in the back of the car. When not in use, the handle could be placed in another hole to the back right of the bumper. The handle was usually molded in the same color as the car. The car shot across the floor when a small black lever was depressed. Some of the later cars were made with a launching ""pad"" mechanism that the car rested on top of, probably because kids could get jabbed in the eye if the original rod wasn't held firmly. It could spring backwards as the original label on the bottom of the car warned.          These cars were produced in about 1:40 scale (5 inches long) and included Ford Torinos (in 1971 and 1972 body styles), a Ford Mustang Mach 1, a Maverick, a Thunderbird, a Mercury Cougar, and a Mercury Montego. They were molded in polystyrene plastic and came in light lime green, orange, yellow, beige, white and a dark maroon red. They appeared almost to be smaller versions of American promotional models, though the orange and maroon colors of plastic were not so opaque in appearance like in traditional 1:25 scale promotional models. Curiously, no dark greens or blues were offered. The cars had very accurate proportions and fair detail. Chassis were molded in a silver gray as were wheels. Tires were a hard black plastic. Because of the launching mechanism there were no interiors.           In Japan, these were sometimes packaged in non-promotional form as ""OK Star"" in a two tier carton that portrayed a driver with racing helmet on. These opened for display with Japanese script printed on the box. The packaging also had illustrations displaying how to use the launchers (71-73 Mustang).          A few General Motors cars in this same style were also offered. One was a 1971 Oldsmobile Omega two-door (the same general style as the Chevrolet Nova). The car came in red molded plastic with the typical Funmate gray base.          Funmate also offered other sizes of cars and other vehicles, almost always in plastic. Some were more sporty or collectible while others were commercial trucks and other vehicles. One example was a replica of a 1972 Lotus Formula One car. This car was also very similar to one made by a company named Jimson Toys. Many, but not all, of these cars had some kind of spring launch platform or ""key"" handle. A similar model looked a bit more like an Indy car, and also a series of closed vehicles that were called ""Grand Prix Racers"" were made and advertised as good for ""140 mph scale speed"".          Friction Volkswagen Beetles and Porsches and different kinds of trucks also appeared in about the same sizes. Some of the truck offerings, among them a cement mixer, a tow truck, a log hauling truck, a forklift and a dump truck. These were about the same length as the cars discussed above.          In the early 1980s, the company made a series of ""puffy stickers"" of NHL players, such as Wayne Gretzky, which could be peeled from a backing and stuck on other surfaces. Also an Apollo space command set of the moon voyage ships was offered. Toy pistols and rifles (some with scopes) were also produced. More recently, Funmate has focused on toys for young children and infants such as rattles, mobiles, dolls, and musical toys.          The Accelerator. 2008. From the Pony Toy Box.

Bolger was born in Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland, and was Leicester City's academy Player of the Year in 2009.          He made his debut in the Football League, while on loan at Bristol Rovers, when he came on as a 78th-minute substitute for Carl Regan in a 6–1 defeat to Walsall on 29 January 2011. He scored an own goal against Brighton and Hove Albion on 5 February 2011 in a 2–4 defeat for Rovers, this defeat left Rovers 23rd in the league one point above Dagenham and Redbridge. In his 4th game for the club against Rochdale on 8 February 2011 he was sent off for the first time in his senior career after a second yellow card for a poor challenge on Chris O'Grady. Bolger's first win with the club came on his 6th appearance against Tranmere Rovers on 8 March 2011. Bolger played the full 90 minutes in the 1–0 victory.

43021655,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43021655,Illinois Compiled Statutes,"The Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) are the codified statutes of a general and permanent nature of Illinois. The compilation organizes the general Acts of Illinois into 67 chapters arranged within 9 major topic areas. The Illinois Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) makes additions, deletions, and changes to ILCS (for example, when new acts become law or existing acts are repealed) by filing documents as provided in Public Act 87-1005.          The compilation is an official compilation by the state and is entirely in the public domain for purposes of federal copyright law; anyone may publish the statutes. There is no official version of the ILCS, but there are several unofficial versions: Illinois State Bar Association's/West's ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"", West's ""Smith–Hurd Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated"", and LexisNexis's ""Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated"".          Illinois officially revised its laws in 1827-29, 1833, 1845, and 1874. In those revisions, bills were passed arranging the laws as alphabetical chapters. (The 1819 session laws can also be considered a revision of the laws in some respects.) Over time, the alphabetical arrangement of the 1874 Illinois Revised Statutes became less useful as some chapters had become huge, unwieldy, and disorganized by the addition of new acts. The Illinois Supreme Court, among others, had pointed out the confusion caused by the poor organization of the outdated Illinois Revised Statutes, and in its 1988 and 1989 annual reports to the General Assembly recommended consideration of recodification.          The 1874 Illinois Revised Statutes were an official arrangement of the statutes by the state in Illinois, but the state did not maintain the organizational scheme. When a new act became law and needed to be placed within the framework of the Illinois Revised Statutes, that task was left to private publishers, but the publishers were not consistent. One publisher might place a new act in one chapter and another publisher place the same new act in another chapter, and even if two publishers placed the act in the same chapter, they each might assign different paragraph numbers. To solve the confusion and decrease the expense to its members, the Illinois State Bar Association decided in the 1930s to endorse the edition of a single publisher and to encourage all of its members to use only that edition. The Bar Association's endorsement solved those problems, but it created another problem: a single publisher making editorial decisions as to where to place new acts in the chapters of the Illinois Revised Statutes allowed that publisher to assert a copyright interest in the arrangement of the Illinois Revised Statutes and to effectively prevent other publishers from entering the market. That publisher was West Publishing Company. Moreover, because the state had not maintained the organization and numbering of the Illinois Revised Statutes, it was an unofficial compilation of the statutes.          In the late 1980s, a dispute arose between West, which claimed a copyright interest, and Mead Data Central (then the owner of the LexisNexis research services), which wanted to publish the Illinois Revised Statutes. The dispute spilled over into the General Assembly and became a heavily lobbied issue, and as a result, in 1987 the General Assembly passed House Bill 1924, which attempted to make the arrangement of the Illinois Revised Statutes official and to put the arrangement into the public domain for purposes of federal copyright law. Governor James Thompson vetoed the bill, stating that he feared it would embroil the state in costly copyright litigation. In 1988, the General Assembly passed House Bill 3896, which had the same provisions as House Bill 1924, and the Governor again vetoed the bill. West and Mead later settled their dispute.          In 1989 the General Assembly passed House Bill 757, which became Public Act 86-523. That act directed the LRB to submit to the General Assembly a plan for the comprehensive and systematic codification of the statutory law. A Preliminary Plan dated November 29, 1990 was submitted. LRB received numerous suggestions from government officials and agencies, bar associations and other private organizations, publishers, and others, and in light of those suggestions, LRB submitted a Revised Plan dated October 22, 1991. The Revised Plan suggested organizing the nearly 2,000 acts into 67 chapters arranged within 9 major topic areas. The Board of the Legislative Reference Bureau held a public hearing on November 6, 1991 concerning the Preliminary and Revised Plans, and those testifying at the hearing generally expressed strong support.          In June 1992 the General Assembly passed House Bill 3810, which became Public Act 87-1005, which directed LRB to file a compilation of the general Acts of Illinois. The compilation was filed by LRB, as directed by Public Act 87-1005, on September 14, 1992. (Alternative sources give the effective date as September 3, 1992.) The compilation is known as the Illinois Compiled Statutes, or ILCS, and took effect January 1, 1993.          The previous official reorganizations of the statutes were also revisions in which new acts were passed that superseded existing acts. Those new acts contained changes to the law that were deemed appropriate. In contrast, the compilation under Public Act 87-1005 was solely a reorganization; it did not make changes to the text of the law. The many problems that arose in the course of the 1874 revision, described in pages 25 through 35 of Statutory Revision in Illinois, might have paled in comparison to the difficulties that would have arisen in an attempt to revise nearly 2,000 acts.","['Illinois law', 'United States state legal codes']"

21437222,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21437222,Poincaré plot,"A Poincaré plot, named after Henri Poincaré, is used to quantify self-similarity in processes, usually periodic functions. It is also known as a return map. Poincaré plots can be used to distinguish chaos from randomness by embedding a data set into a higher-dimensional state space.          Given a time series of the form          a return map in its simplest form first plots (""x"", ""x""), then plots (""x"", ""x""), then (""x"", ""x""), and so on.          An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a tracing of the voltage changes in the chest generated by the heart, whose contraction in the normal person is triggered by an electrical impulse that originates from its ""pacemaker"", the sinoatrial node. The ECG normally consists of a series of waves, labeled the P, Q, R, S and T waves. The P wave is due to the depolarization of the atria, the Q-R-S series of waves due to depolarization of the ventricles, and the T wave due to the repolarization (the opposite of depolarization) of the ventricles. The interval between two successive R waves (the RR interval) is a measure of the heart rate.          The heart rate normally varies slightly: during a deep breath, it speeds up and during a deep exhalation, it slows down. (The RR interval will shorten when the heart speeds up, and lengthen when it slows.) An RR tachograph is a graph of the numerical value of the RR-interval (measured heartbeat-to-heartbeat) versus time.           In the context of RR tachography, a Poincare plot (which is a special case of a recurrence plot) is a graph of RR(""n"") on the ""x""-axis versus RR(""n"" + 1) - i.e., the succeeding RR interval - on the ""y""-axis. That is, one takes takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval.          The recurrence plot is used as a standard visualizing technique to detect the presence of oscillations in non-linear dynamic systems. In the context of electrocardiography, the rate of the healthy heart is normally tightly controlled by the body's regulatory mechanisms (specifically, by the autonomic nervous system). An increase in the variability of heart rate suggests pathological conditions: it often increases after a myocardial infarction (""heart attack""), either because the sinoatrial node (pacemaker) is damaged, or because the damaged heart tissue produces abnormal electric current that cause the ventricles to beat prematurely or irregularly.","['Scaling symmetries', 'Dynamical systems', 'Chaos theory', 'Statistical charts and diagrams']"

37911732,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37911732,United States Motion Picture Corporation,"The United States Motion Picture Corporation was an early American independent film studio that produced comedic films on the East Coast. It existed during the ""transitional"" period before the Hollywood studio system centralized film production. The United States Motion Picture Corporation made one reel silent films in the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area from 1916 through 1919.          Incorporated in New Jersey on March 2, 1915, The United States Motion Picture Corporation established its main office in the Savoy Building in downtown Wilkes-Barre. Its studios were located across the Susquehanna River in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, on Slocum Street near Wyoming Avenue. The company's studio, established in Forty Fort by the summer of 1915, was a glass and steel building that looked somewhat like a greenhouse, designed to allow maximum light for filming          The United States Motion Picture Corporation was founded by James O. Walsh, who was its president, Fred W. Hermann, who was the vice president, and Daniel L. Hart, who was its treasurer and is also listed as its scenario editor in one newspaper account. Hart, an award-winning playwright, would later serve as the mayor of Wilkes-Barre from 1920 to his death in 1933.           Between October 2, 1916 and November 12, 1917, the United States Motion Picture Corporation produced and released twenty-seven Black Diamond Comedies. ""Black Diamond"" referred to anthracite coal, deposits of which had made Wilkes-Barre and the surrounding area a center of the mining industry and contributed to the region's wealth. The one-reel silent films were the first comedies distributed by Paramount Pictures, which was then based in New York. Paramount advertised these comedies widely in 1917, sometimes alongside those of Fatty Arbuckle, another Paramount comic artist. The films often followed a comic character named Susie, portrayed by USMPC’s leading lady Leatrice Joy, through mishaps and blunders. The films' advertisements that appear in ""The Moving Picture World"" magazine note the use of comic special effects with stop action and film speed experimentation.          After the company ended its contract with Paramount Pictures in 1917, USMPC released six additional one-reel comic films as Unique Comedies, which were distributed by the Arrow Film Company of New York. These include ""His Neglected Wife,"" which also stars Leatrice Joy and other actors who appeared in Black Diamond Comedies.          The United States Motion Picture Corporation also released Rainbow Comedies, one-reel comic films distributed by the General Film Company, in 1918 and 1919. These films often starred Lillian Vera and Eddie Boulden and were directed by Joseph A. Richmond.          The United States Motion Picture Corporation stopped producing films in 1919. The company's studios in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania were subsequently used by the Serico Company, which filmed its serial ""A Woman in Grey"" in 1920.          Three films produced by the United States Motion Picture Corporation are known to survive, the Black Diamond Comedies films ""Her Fractured Voice"" and ""Susie Slips One Over"", and the Unique Comedies film ""His Neglected Wife"".          The Prelinger Archives digitized its print of ""Her Fractured Voice"" and made it available online. The film features scenes of downtown Wilkes-Barre, including images of the original fountain in the city's Public Square.           Film prints of ""Susie Slips One Over"" are held at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Margaret Herrick Library in Los Angeles also holds a poster for the film. In 2012, The UCLA Film and Television Archive deposited a DVD of the film with the Luzerne County Historical Society archive in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.           Only one print of the United States Motion Pictures Corporation films released under the Unique Comedies title is known to exist, ""His Neglected Wife"" starring Leatrice Joy. The film was discovered in a vault in New Zealand and was returned to the United States for restoration at George Eastman House in 2010. The film features images of the historic Hotel Sterling in Wllkes-Barre, which was torn down in 2013. Charles Petrillo, a historian in Wilkes-Barre, sponsored this restoration and has ensured that a DVD copy of the film will be placed at the Luzerne County Historical Society archives for further study.          On October 26, 2012, King's College and the Luzerne County Historical Society cosponsored a screening of the films ""Her Fractured Voice"", ""His Neglected Wife"", and ""Flesh and Spirit"".

876073,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876073,John Kahn,"John Kahn (June 13, 1947 - May 30, 1996) was an American rock and roll bass guitarist. From 1970 to 1995, Kahn was Jerry Garcia's principal musical collaborator outside of the Grateful Dead.          John Kahn was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Adopted at birth by the Kahn family, he grew up in Beverly Hills, California. At Beverly Hills High School, he earned a reputation as a precocious musician playing jazz guitar and composing a symphonic piece, ""Western Impressions"", the first orchestral work by a student to be publicly performed by the school's orchestra under the direction of Robert Holmes.          In his junior year, Kahn switched to double bass and formed a jazz duo with a pianist, Peter Isackson, who encouraged him to study with Monty Budwig, a member of the house rhythm section at Shelly's Manne-hole. He moved to Sausalito, California in 1965, where he began to gravitate toward the incipient rock culture of the Haight-Ashbury district in nearby San Francisco. In 1967, he began working as a session musician with a litany of notable blues, folk, and rock performers, including Mike Bloomfield, Nick Gravenites, Mississippi Fred McDowell, John Lee Hooker, Brewer & Shipley (a longstanding collaboration that encompassed their 1971 Top Ten hit ""One Toke Over the Line""), Tom Fogerty, Maria Muldaur, Al Kooper, Jackie DeShannon, and Otis Rush.          Kahn first played with Garcia in May 1970 as the bassist of a jazz rock group that coalesced around Garcia and organist Howard Wales during Monday night jam sessions at The Matrix, a San Francisco nightclub of the era; this ensemble would go on to record ""Hooteroll?"" (1971; credited to Garcia and Wales). He also played acoustic bass in Old and in the Way, a bluegrass supergroup that toured in 1973 and 1974. Along with Kahn, the band featured Garcia on banjo and vocals, future progressive bluegrass luminary David Grisman on mandolin and vocals, Peter Rowan on guitar and vocals, and Vassar Clements on fiddle. From 1970 to 1975, Kahn played in the Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia Band and was an integral part of later iterations of the Garcia/Saunders collaboration, including Legion of Mary (1974-1975) and Reconstruction (1978-1979); ironically, the latter group was initially intended to serve as a musical outlet for Kahn during Garcia's tours with the Grateful Dead. Kahn was the only founding member of the Jerry Garcia Band (1975-1995) to remain with the group until its dissolution following Garcia's death in 1995. He also played alongside Garcia in the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band (1987-1988) and served as the guitarist's only accompanist in the Garcia & Kahn acoustic duo that toured intermittently from 1982 to 1989.          Kahn did occasional work for the Grateful Dead, serving as a recording engineer alongside Betty Cantor-Jackson and Bob Matthews for the band's aborted ""Egypt '78"" live album documenting performances at the Giza Plateau in September 1978; selections from these concerts were eventually released as """" (2008). He also contributed organ and additional production to ""Shakedown Street"" (1978) following the departure of nominal producer Lowell George.          He died of a heart attack in his sleep on May 30, 1996.","['1947 births', '1996 deaths', 'People from Memphis, Tennessee', 'American rock bass guitarists', 'American Jews', 'Jerry Garcia', '20th-century American musicians']"
46743913,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46743913,Guryong Village,"Guryong or Guryong Village () is an illegal encampment (commonly called a slum or a shantytown) on private land in Seoul, South Korea, on the edge of the affluent southside district of Dogok-dong, Gangnam District from which it is separated by a six-lane motorway.          It was first created in 1988 by people evicted from houses in other low-income areas demolished during the city's rapid development prior to the 1988 Olympic Games, and who came to this area as their last refuge. Since at least 2011, there have been plans for re-purposing the area and relocating the residents, though little progress has been made due to disagreements between officials on the best plan of action. Current government plans propose to demolish Guryong in 2015 and arrange subsidized housing for residents. It has an estimated 2,500 to 4,000 inhabitants (all numbers are estimates as no demographic survey of that area has ever been conducted), primarily impoverished elderly, living in between 1,200 and 2,000 shacks and trailers in a village area of about 286,929 square meters (about 70 acres). Individual houses have the size of about 16 to 99 square meters. The residents, who have established a postal service in their area, have received temporary residence cards in 2011. The village has buildings like kindergarten and church, utilities like water, gas and electricity, for which payments are communal; and its own security, all organized through two village associations.          Due to unsafe construction, the village has been affected by a number of fire accidents.          It has been called ""the last slum in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district"" and ""the last shanty town in Gangnam"" and, broader, ""the last remaining urban slum in Seoul"".","['Neighbourhoods of Seoul', 'Slums in Asia', 'Shanty towns in Asia', '1988 establishments in South Korea']"

26476627,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26476627,Future Husband,"""Future Husband"" is the of the fourth season of the American television comedy series ""30 Rock"". It was directed by series producer Don Scardino, and written by Jon Haller and Tracey Wigfield. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 11, 2010. Elizabeth Banks, James Rebhorn, and Michael Sheen guest star in the episode, and there are cameo appearances by Jack Welch and Brian Williams.          In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) finds a mysterious number in her phone under the name ""Future Husband."" At the same time, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric (GE), Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is informed that a cable company is rumored to buy out NBC. Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) stages a one-man show in an attempt to win a Tony Award, as part of his EGOT quest. The episode makes reference to the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by the cable company network Comcast.          ""Future Husband"" received generally mixed reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 5.894 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.9 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic.          Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) comes across an unrecognized contact in her cellphone listed as ""future husband"", and realizes that it must be a man she met at her dental appointment with Dr. Kaplan (James Rebhorn), while awakening from anesthesia in the recovery room after root canal surgery (seen in the previous episode). She calls the number, pretends to be the Jamaican dental receptionist, and asks the man to come back to see Dr. Kaplan. At the appointed time, she returns to the dentist's office, but does not recognize anyone there; so she calls the number again. When the man (Michael Sheen) answers, she sees him and hangs up. Unbeknownst to Liz, her number is already listed in his cellphone under ""future wife"". He calls her back upon seeing she called, and they arrange a date; she learns that his name is Wesley. On their date, the two fail to hit it off: they find each other annoying and share many flaws but few interests. Later, at the 30 Rock studios, Liz discovers that Wesley was the person who retrieved NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) wallet, after Kenneth threw it out of a window earlier. Because of this coincidence, Liz and Wesley decide to go on another date.          At the same time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) aspirations of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) comes to a halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, ""The Hot Box"", Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.          Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) performs a one-man show on Broadway so that he can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.          ""Future Husband"" was directed by series producer Don Scardino, and was written by Jon Haller and Tracey Wigfield. This was Haller's first penned script, and was Wigfield's second writing credit, having co-written ""Jackie Jormp-Jomp"" for the show's third season. ""Future Husband"" originally aired in the United States on March 11, 2010, on NBC as the of the fourth season. This episode of ""30 Rock"" was filmed on December 17, 2009.          In December 2009, it was confirmed that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest star on the show, and in this episode, she played right-wing CNBC anchor Avery Jessup, and love interest to the Jack Donaghy character, played by Alec Baldwin. In an interview with ""Entertainment Weekly"", Banks revealed that she approached the ""30 Rock"" staff about making an appearance as she is a fan of the show. ""I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true."" She also revealed that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having ""too much fun"" making movies to commit to a television show full-time. Banks made her debut as Avery Jessup in the previous episode ""Anna Howard Shaw Day"". In January 2010, it was announced that actor Michael Sheen would guest star as a love interest for Liz Lemon, played by series creator Tina Fey. In this episode, he made his debut as the character Wesley. Liz and Wesley's story arc continued in the episodes ""Don Geiss, America and Hope"", ""Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land"", and ""I Do Do"".          In ""Future Husband"", Jack learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch that current GE CEO Don Geiss, played by Rip Torn, has died. Torn did not make any appearances in this season, marking his last role as Don Geiss in the episode ""Larry King"" that aired on February 26, 2009, during the third season. Television writer Bob Sassone of TV Squad wondered if Torn was written out of the series due to an alcohol-related incident that occurred to Torn in January 2010. Welch appeared as himself here and was chairman and CEO of GE from 1981 until 2001. Actor James Rebhorn, best known for his current role as a special agent in the USA Network crime comedy-drama ""White Collar"", made his debut as the character Dr. Kaplan, Liz and Wesley's dentist. This was news anchor Brian Williams' third guest appearance as himself. In the scene in which he appears, Williams engages in smack talk in the CNBC offices, telling Avery and her colleagues that his news program ""NBC Nightly News"" ""rules"".          The storyline in ""Future Husband"" involving the fictitious Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown purchasing NBC is based on the acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast in November 2009. After winning her fourth Screen Actors Guild Award as her television character at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards in January 2010, Fey was asked whether or not ""30 Rock"" would make reference to the Comcast acquisition to which she said that it would be dealt with. ""The sale of NBC to another company is integral to our show and it will be hard for Jack."" In April 2010, the NBC network created a website for Kabletown. When asked by a contributor from ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"" why the characters on ""30 Rock"" refer to the network's new owner as ""Kabletown, with a K"", co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that the reason for this was that the staff writers came up with the name ""Cabletown"", however, they later learned that there was a real company with a similar name, so NBC's legal team department ""wanted to emphasize the difference, and after a while, everyone just liked the sound of it.""          This was the second time the series referenced the Tracy Jordan character trying to get his EGOT. This plot first began in the December 3, 2009, episode ""Dealbreakers Talk Show"" in which Tracy finds a diamond encrusted ""EGOT"" necklace and sets a new life goal to achieve EGOT status by winning four major awards: an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. In the episode, Tracy performs a one-man show so that he can get a Tony Award.          In the beginning of this episode, Liz asks where Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) is, as he is one of her staff writers and she wants him to write some Winter Olympics sketches. This results in Liz breaking the fourth wall—a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience—where she mouths speech that is unintelligible, while her voice is heard saying ""Lindsey Vonn!"" who won the ""gold medal for skiing!""          Kenneth references the 1987 thriller film ""Fatal Attraction"" after encouraging Liz to meet with her ""future husband"" and deeming it a romantic situation, saying ""Just like that movie I only saw the first 10 minutes of, ""Fatal Attraction""!"". The movie is about a married man who has a weekend affair with a woman who refuses to end the affair as she becomes obsessed with him. In addition, Jane Krakowski appeared in ""Fatal Attraction"". Kenneth later has a dream that seems to be influenced by the movie ""The Shining,"" telling Jenna, ""Late at night these two little twin girls told me they wanted to play with me forever."" He also references the story of Lot and his daughters from the Bible, and a vignette from ""Saved by the Bell"" involving characters Samuel ""Screech"" Powers and Lisa Turtle.          Wondering why he has not seen any of his GE colleagues, Jack's office assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) suggests that maybe they are the last people on Earth, as he references the 2007 film ""I Am Legend"", ""You're Will Smith and I'm the dog!"" In ""I Am Legend"", Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order to figure out what is going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of """" (1996). After Kenneth convinces her to call her ""future husband"", Liz, who speaks in a Jamaican accent as Dr. Kaplan's dental assistants are Jamaican women, tells the man he needs to come into Dr. Kaplan's office for some work, and Liz ends the call with """"Cool Runnings"", man! Bobsled!"" This is a reference to the comedy movie ""Cool Runnings"" (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team's made their debut the 1988 Winter Olympics. In another scene, Liz's ringtone is the song ""Fuck the Pain Away"" by Canadian electronic musician Peaches.          While giving elocution lessons to Tracy, Jenna quotes the song ""I Am So Proud"" from Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Mikado"" when she asks him to repeat the phrase, ""To sit in solemn silence in a dull dark dock/Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp, shock.""          In its original American broadcast, ""Future Husband"" was watched by 5.894 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received a 2.9 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic, meaning that 2.9 percent of all people in that group, and 8 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. During its original broadcast, ""Future Husband"" ranked fourth in its 9:30 p.m. slot, behind CBS's crime drama """", ABC's medical series ""Grey's Anatomy"", and Fox's reality show ""Kitchen Nightmares"".          Leonard Pierce of ""The A.V. Club"" was not positive in his review, describing ""Future Husband"" as the ""laziest"" episode of the fourth season. Nonetheless, Pierce responded favorably to Tracy's one-man show, calling it the ""shortest and best of the plots"" and ""even manages to get a laugh out of that old 'I'd watch him reading the phone book' chestnut."" Sean Gandert for ""Paste"" magazine said in his recap that part of this episode was disappointing, writing that the main plot was not ""too awful, [it was] just comparatively dull."" Though, he was positive towards the show's interpretation of the NBC and Kabletown storyline, saying it was a nice ""little riff"" on the actual merger between NBC and Comcast. Gandert was appreciative to Elizabeth Banks' small part, and hoped to see her in future episodes. ""Entertainment Weekly"" contributor Margaret Lyons opined it was a ""strange"" episode of ""30 Rock"", and concluded ""It's not that 'Future Husband' was radically terrible or anything, but wow, that episode just did not click into place."" Bob Sassone of TV Squad did not enjoy Jenna's involvement in Tracy's story, and that overall he did not find their antics ""too funny"". Nonetheless, Sassone enjoyed Brian Williams' cameo.          IGN contributor Robert Canning wrote that the NBC/Comcast reference here ""wasn't exactly a well of laughs, but Baldwin's Donaghy kept the story entertaining enough to want to follow it."" He enjoyed Banks' appearance, noting that her standout moment came when Avery and Jack argued over the direction of NBC ""and for that brief moment Banks stole the show from Baldwin."" In conclusion, Canning gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. James Poniewozik of ""Time"" magazine said that the main story ""played more like a subplot even though it gave the episode its title"". He added that there were some fine moments, and that overall Liz and Jack's plots ""have the potential to give the show some interesting forward movement"". ""Los Angeles Times"" contributor Meredith Blake felt that Michael Sheen was ""underused"" in his role, and observed that Jack and Avery's relationship showcased here seemed ""remarkably convincing."" Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for ""The Star-Ledger"" wrote that the episode's storytelling was ""better than it's been in recent weeks"", however, was not complimentary towards Liz meeting Sheen's Wesley, as he felt that their plot fell flat.","['30 Rock (season 4) episodes', '2010 television episodes']"

37331091,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37331091,Comet (pinball),"Comet is a pinball machine released by Williams in June 1985. It was designed by Barry Oursler and was the first in a Rollercoaster/Carnival themed pinball trilogy followed by ""Cyclone"" in 1988 and ""Hurricane"" in 1991.          In this pinball game, the player attempts to navigate throughout a representation of a Carnival, with the namesake ""Comet"" being a central ramp representing a roller coaster, normally worth 10,000 points. Two banks of Shooting Gallery targets (""Rabbits"" and ""Ducks"") can be targeted to score points and advance the matching bonus counter. Each bonus track is worth a maximum of 63,000 points. Hitting all four targets in a target bank lights an additional objective, which allows you to collect the matching bonus during play by completing the Whirlwind ramp (for Ducks) or the Funhouse saucer (for Rabbits). Completing both target banks lights additional points for the center ramp (30,000, 50,000, 100,000, and one more 100,000 per sequential shot), including the chance for extra balls and replays depending on specific game settings. Completing the ramp advances both bonuses.          The most definitive feature of Comet is a ""Motorcycle Jump"" ramp on the upper-right side of the playfield. This features a Skee ball-like scoring setup, where the closest target is worth 20,000, the middle target is worth 50,000, and the farthest target is worth 200,000. Completing the ramp advances both bonuses. The ramp starts each ball in a lit state, then becomes unlit after being scored.          ""Comet"" features a relatively unique flipper area arrangement. On the right side, there is no inlane and on the left side, the inlane and outlane are inverted. What would normally be an inlane on a conventional pinball machine instead causes the ball to drain. The left inlane relights the Motorcycle Jump ramp, and the two outlanes advance the bonus.          Next to the central ""Comet"" ramp is a drop target that reveals the ""Dunk The Dummy"" target. Once the drop target is hit, the ""dummy"" will taunt the player using voice sounds (""Hey Turkey!"", ""Hit me, Turkey!""). Hitting the Dunk The Dummy target will increase the bonus multiplier by one step(2x, 3x, 5x).          At the top of the playfield is a set of four rollover targets that spell out ""1-9-8-6"". Completing these four targets will activate a playfield point multiplier for a limited time. By default this is a 2x multiplier, but is 3x on the second ball, and 5x on the final ball (i.e. ""2x, 3x, 5x"" in three-ball play and ""2x, 3x, 2x, 2x, 5x"" in five-ball play). ""Comet"" has the ability to cycle the already lit targets towards the right by activating the right flipper, using the ""Lane Change"" feature.          If the 5x playfield multiplier is lit at the same time as the Motorcycle Jump ramp is lit, a voice will announce ""One Million!"" and additional playfield lights will highlight the Motorcycle Jump ramp. Completing the longest jump at this time will award one million points (200,000 times 5x). ""Comet"" was the first solid-state machine to feature a one million point shot.","['Williams pinball machines', '1985 pinball machines']"

This site is home to one of Telefís Éireann's original five main television transmitters. Coming on air in December 1962, initially on low power, it was in full operation by September 1963 with a 625-line VHF service for the Southwest of Ireland, namely counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick. Today it is owned and operated by 2RN a subsidiary of RTÉ. In 2009 in preparation for the transmission of digital terrestrial television (DTT), a new mast was erected at Mullaghanish with a height of 225m, making it the tallest television transmitter in Ireland, the original 170m mast was subsequently removed. Analogue television transmissions from this site ended on 24 October 2012, and the national DTT service, Saorview, is now broadcast from Mullaghanish at an ERP of 200 kW, making this the most powerful television transmitter in all of Ireland, a distinction formerly attributed to the Cairn Hill (analogue) transmitter in County Longford.          As well as digital television, six national FM radio services are broadcast from the site, all using vertical polarisation. Local station, Radio Kerry, is broadcast from a directional antenna pointing west, into its target service area of County Kerry, and Newstalk is broadcast in mono.          The Mullaghanish transmitter also has the highest number of relays (20) of any television transmitter in Ireland reflecting the difficult topography of its service area.","['Radio masts and towers in Europe', 'Marilyns of Ireland', 'Hewitts of Ireland', 'Mountains and hills of County Kerry', 'Mountains and hills of County Cork', 'Radio in Ireland', 'Media in the Republic of Ireland', 'Transmitter sites in Ireland', 'Mountains under 1000 metres']"
16024,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16024,Justus von Liebig,"Justus Freiherr von Liebig (12 May 1803 – 18 April 1873) was a German chemist who made major contributions to agricultural and biological chemistry, and was considered the founder of organic chemistry. As a professor at the University of Giessen, he devised the modern laboratory-oriented teaching method, and for such innovations, he is regarded one of the greatest chemistry teachers of all time. He has been described as the ""father of the fertilizer industry"" for his emphasis on nitrogen and certain minerals as essential plant nutrients, and his formulation of the Law of the Minimum which described the effect of individual nutrients on crops. He also developed a manufacturing process for beef extracts, and founded a company, Liebig Extract of Meat Company, that later trademarked the Oxo brand beef bouillon cube.          Justus von Liebig was born in Darmstadt into the middle-class family of Johann Georg Liebig and Maria Caroline Möser in early May 1803. His father was a drysalter and hardware merchant who compounded and sold paints, varnishes and pigments, which he developed in his own workshop. From childhood Justus was fascinated with chemistry.          At the age of 13, Liebig lived through the year without a summer, when the majority of food-crops in the northern hemisphere were destroyed by a volcanic winter. Germany was among the hardest-hit in the global famine that ensued, and the experience is said to have shaped Liebig's later work. Thanks in part to Liebig's innovations in fertilizers and agriculture, the 1816 famine became known as ""the last great subsistence crisis in the Western world"".          Liebig attended grammar school at the Ludwig-Georgs-Gymnasium in Darmstadt, from the age of 8 to 14. Leaving without a certificate of completion, he was apprenticed for several months to the apothecary Gottfried Pirsch (1792–1870) in Heppenheim before returning home, possibly because his father could not afford to pay his indentures. He worked with his father for the next two years, then attended the University of Bonn, studying under Karl Wilhelm Gottlob Kastner, a business associate of his father. When Kastner moved to the University of Erlangen, Liebig followed him.          Liebig left Erlangen in March 1822, in part because of his involvement with the radical Korps Rhenania (a nationalist student organization) but also because of his hopes for more advanced chemical studies. The circumstances are clouded by possible scandal. In late 1822 Liebig went to study in Paris on a grant obtained for him by Kastner from the Hessian government. He worked in the private laboratory of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and was also befriended by Alexander von Humboldt and Georges Cuvier (1769–1832). Liebig's doctorate from Erlangen was conferred on 23 June 1823, a considerable time after he left, as a result of Kastner's intervention on his behalf. Kastner pleaded that the requirement of a dissertation be waived, and the degree granted ""in absentia"".          Liebig left Paris to return to Darmstadt in April 1824. On 26 May 1824 at the age of 21 and with Humboldt's recommendation, Liebig became a professor ""extraordinarius"" at the University of Giessen. Liebig's appointment was part of an attempt to modernize the University of Giessen and attract more students. He received a small stipend, without laboratory funding or access to facilities.          His situation was complicated by the presence of existing faculty: Professor Wilhelm Zimmermann (1780–1825) taught general chemistry as part of the philosophy faculty, leaving medical chemistry and pharmacy to Professor Philipp Vogt in the medical faculty. Vogt was happy to support a reorganization in which pharmacy was taught by Liebig and became the responsibility of the faculty of arts, rather than the faculty of medicine. Zimmermann found himself competing unsuccessfully with Liebig for students and their lecture fees. He refused to allow Liebig to use existing space and equipment, and finally committed suicide on 19 July 1825. The deaths of Zimmermann and a Professor Blumhof who taught technology and mining opened the way for Liebig to apply for a full professorship. Liebig was appointed to the ""ordentlicher"" chair in chemistry on 7 December 1825, receiving a considerably increased salary and a laboratory allowance.          Liebig married Henriette ""Jettchen"" Moldenhauer (1807–1881), the daughter of a state official, in May 1826. They had five children, Georg (1827–1903), Agnes (1828–1862), Hermann (1831–1894), Johanna (1836–1925) and Marie (1845–1920). Although Liebig was Lutheran and Jettchen Catholic, their differences in religion appear to have been resolved amicably by bringing their sons up in the Lutheran religion and their daughters as Catholics.          Liebig and several associates proposed to create an institute for pharmacy and manufacturing within the university. The Senate, however, uncompromisingly rejected their idea, stating that it was not the university's task to train ""apothecaries, soapmakers, beer-brewers, dyers and vinegar-distillers."" As of 17 December 1825, they ruled that any such institution would have to be a private venture. This decision actually worked to Liebig's advantage. As an independent venture, he could ignore university rules and accept both matriculated and non-matriculated students. Liebig's institute was widely advertised in pharmaceutical journals, and opened in 1826. Its classes in practical chemistry and laboratory procedures for chemical analysis were taught in addition to Liebig's formal courses at the university.          From 1825 to 1835, the laboratory was housed in the guardroom of a disused barracks on the edge of town. The main laboratory space was about 38 square metres, including a small lecture room, a storage closet, and a main room with ovens and work tables. An open colonnade outside could be used for dangerous reactions. Liebig could work there with 8 or 9 students at a time. He lived in a cramped apartment on the floor above with his wife and children.          Liebig was one of the first chemists to organize a laboratory in its present form, engaging with students in empirical research on a large scale through a combination of research and teaching. His methods of organic analysis enabled him to direct the analytical work of many graduate students. Liebig's students were from many of the German states as well as Britain and the United States, and they helped create an international reputation for their ""Doktorvater."" His laboratory became renowned as a model institution for the teaching of practical chemistry. It was also significant for its emphasis on applying discoveries in fundamental research to the development of specific chemical processes and products.          In 1833, Liebig was able to convince chancellor Justin von Linde to include the institute within the university. In 1839, he obtained government funds to build a lecture theatre and 2 separate laboratories, designed by architect Paul Hofmann. The new chemistry laboratory featured innovative glass-fronted fume cupboards and venting chimneys. By 1852, when he left Giessen for Munich, more than 700 students of chemistry and pharmacy had studied with Liebig.          A significant challenge facing nineteenth century organic chemists was the lack of instruments and methods of analysis to support accurate, replicable analyses of organic materials. Many chemists worked on the problem of organic analysis, including French Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Swedish Jöns Jacob Berzelius, before Liebig developed his version of an apparatus for determining the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of organic substances in 1830. It involved an ingenious array of five glass bulbs, called a ""Kaliapparat"" to trap oxidation products. Water was absorbed in a bulb of hygroscopic calcium chloride which was weighed to measure hydrogen. Carbon dioxide was absorbed in a potassium hydroxide solution in the three lower bulbs and used to measure carbon. Oxygen was calculated from the difference. A coal fire was used for combustion. Weighing carbon and hydrogen directly, rather than estimating them volumetrically, greatly increased the method's accuracy of measurement. Liebig's assistant Carl Ettling perfected glass-blowing techniques for producing the kaliapparat, and demonstrated them to visitors. Liebig's kaliapparat simplified the technique of quantitative organic analysis and rendered it routine. Brock suggests that the availability of a superior technical apparatus was one reason why Liebig was able to attract so many students to his laboratory. His method of combustion analysis was used pharmaceutically, and certainly made possible many contributions to organic, agricultural and biological chemistry.          Liebig also popularized use of a counter-current water-cooling system for distillation, still referred to as a Liebig condenser. Liebig himself attributed the vapor condensation device to German pharmacist Johann Friedrich August Gottling, who had made improvements in 1794 to a design discovered independently by German chemist Christian Ehrenfried Weigel in 1771, by French scientist, P. J. Poisonnier in 1779, and by Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin in 1791.          Although it was not widely adopted until after Liebig's death, when safety legislation finally prohibited the use of mercury in making mirrors, Liebig proposed a process for silvering that eventually became the basis of modern mirror-making. In 1835 he reported that aldehydes reduce silver salts to metallic silver. After working with other scientists, Carl August von Steinheil approached Liebig in 1856 to see if he could develop a silvering technique capable of producing high-quality optical mirrors for use in reflecting telescopes. Liebig was able to develop blemish-free mirrors by adding copper to ammoniated silver nitrate and sugar. An attempt to commercialize the process and ""drive out mercury mirror-making and its injurious influence on workers' health"" was unsuccessful.          One of Liebig's frequent collaborators was Friedrich Wöhler. They met in 1826 in Frankfurt, after independently reporting on the preparation of two substances, cyanic acid and fulminic acid, that apparently had the same composition but very different characteristics. The silver fulminate investigated by Liebig, was explosive, whereas the silver cyanate found by Wöhler, was not. After reviewing the disputed analyses together, they agreed that both were valid. The discovery of these and other substances led Jöns Jacob Berzelius to suggest the idea of isomers, substances that are defined not simply by the number and kind of atoms in the molecule but also by the arrangement of those atoms.          In 1832, Justus Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler published an investigation of the oil of bitter almonds. They transformed pure oil into several halogenated compounds, which were further transformed in other reactions. Throughout these transformations, ""a single compound"" (which they named benzoyl) ""preserves its nature and composition unchanged in nearly all its associations with other bodies."" Their experiments proved that a group of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms can behave like an element, take the place of an element, and can be exchanged for elements in chemical compounds. This laid the foundation for the doctrine of compound radicals, which can be seen as an early step in the development of structural chemistry.          The 1830s were a period of intense investigation of organic compounds by Liebig and his students, and of vigorous debate about the theoretical implications of their results. Liebig published on a wide variety of topics, personally averaging thirty papers per year between 1830 and 1840. Liebig not only isolated individual substances, but also studied their interrelationships and the ways in which they degraded and metamorphosed into other substances, looking for clues to the understanding of both chemical composition and physiological function. Other significant contributions by Liebig during this time include his examination of          the nitrogen content of bases;           the study of chlorination and the isolation of chloral (1832);          the identification of the ethyl radical (1834);          the oxidation of alcohol and formation of aldehyde (1835);          the polybasic theory of organic acids (1838);          and the degradation of urea (1837).          Writing about the analysis of urine, a complex organic product, he made a declaration that reveals both the changes that were occurring in chemistry over a short time and the impact of his own work. At a time when many chemists such as Jöns Jakob Berzelius still insisted on a hard and fast separation between the organic and inorganic, Liebig asserted:          Liebig's arguments against any chemical distinction between living (physiological) and dead chemical processes proved a great inspiration to several of his students and others who were interested in materialism. Though Liebig distanced himself from the direct political implications of materialism, he tacitly supported the work of Karl Vogt (1817–1895), Jacob Moleschott (1822–1893), and Ludwig Büchner (1824–1899).          By the 1840s, Liebig was attempting to apply theoretical knowledge from organic chemistry to real-world problems of food availability. His book ""Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie (Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology)"" (1840) promoted the idea that chemistry could revolutionize agricultural practice, increasing yields and lowering costs. It was widely translated, vociferously critiqued, and highly influential.          Liebig's book discussed chemical transformations within living systems, both plant and animal, outlining a theoretical approach to agricultural chemistry. The first part of the book focused on plant nutrition, the second on chemical mechanisms of putrefaction and decay. Liebig's awareness of both synthesis and degradation led him to become an early advocate of conservation, promoting ideas such as the recycling of sewage.          Liebig argued against prevalent theories about role of humus in plant nutrition, which held that decayed plant matter was the primary source of carbon for plant nutrition. Fertilizers were believed to act by breaking down humus, making it easier for plants to absorb. Associated with such ideas was the belief that some sort of ""vital force"" distinguished reactions involving organic as opposed to inorganic materials.          Early studies of photosynthesis had identified carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as important, but disagreed over their sources and mechanisms of action. Carbon dioxide was known to be taken in and oxygen released during photosynthesis, but researchers suggested that oxygen was obtained from carbon dioxide, rather than from water. Hydrogen was believed to come primarily from water. Researchers disagreed about whether sources of carbon and nitrogen were atmospheric or soil-based. Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure's experiments, reported in ""Recherches Chimiques sur la Végétation"" (1804), suggested that carbon was obtained from atmospheric rather than soil-based sources, and that water was a likely source of hydrogen. He also studied the absorption of minerals by plants, and observed that mineral concentrations in plants tended to reflect their presence in the soil in which the plants were grown. However, the implications of De Saussure's results for theories of plant nutrition were neither clearly discussed nor easily understood.          Liebig reaffirmed the importance of De Saussures' findings, and used them to critique humus theories, while regretting the limitations of De Saussure's experimental techniques. Using more precise methods of measurement as a basis for estimation, he pointed out contradictions such as the inability of existing soil humus to provide enough carbon to support the plants growing in it. By the late 1830s, researchers like Karl Sprengel were using Liebig's methods of combustion analysis to assess manures, concluding that their value could be attributed to their constituent minerals. Liebig synthesized ideas about the mineral theory of plant nutrition and added his own conviction that inorganic materials could provide nutrients as effectively as organic sources.          In his theory of mineral nutrients, Liebig identified the chemical elements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) as essential to plant growth. He reported that plants acquire Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) from the atmosphere and from water (H2O). As well as emphasizing the importance of minerals in the soil, he argued that plants feed on nitrogen compounds derived from the air. This assertion was a source of contention for many years, and turned out to be true for legumes, but not for other plants.          Liebig also popularized Carl Sprengel's ""Theorem of minimum"" (known as Law of the Minimum), stating that plant growth is not determined by the total resources available, but by the scarcest available resource. A plant's development is limited by the one essential mineral that is in the relatively shortest supply. This concept of limitation can be visualized as ""Liebig's barrel"", a metaphorical barrel in which each stave represents a different element. A nutrient stave that is shorter than the others will cause the liquid contained in the barrel to spill out at that level. This is a qualitative version of the principles used for determining the application of fertilizer in modern agriculture.          ""Organic Chemistry"" was not intended as a guide to practical agriculture. Liebig's lack of experience in practical applications, and differences between editions of the book, fueled considerable criticism. Nonetheless, Liebig’s writings had a profound impact on agriculture, spurring experiment and theoretical debate in Germany, England, and France.          One of his most recognized accomplishments is the development of nitrogen-based fertilizer. In the first two editions of his book (1840, 1842), Liebig reported that there was not sufficient nitrogen in the atmosphere, and argued that nitrogen-based fertilizer was needed to grow the healthiest possible crops. Liebig believed that nitrogen could be supplied in the form of ammonia, and recognized the possibility of substituting chemical fertilizers for natural ones (animal dung, etc.)          He later became convinced that nitrogen was sufficiently supplied by precipitation of ammonia from the atmosphere, and argued vehemently against the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers for many years. An early commercial attempt to produce his own fertilizers was unsuccessful, due to lack of testing in actual agricultural conditions, and to lack of nitrogen in the mixtures.          Liebig's difficulties in reconciling theory and practice reflected that the real world of agriculture was more complex than was at first realized. By the publication of the seventh German edition of ""Agricultural Chemistry"" he had moderated some of his views, admitting some mistakes and returning to the position that nitrogen-based fertilizers were beneficial or even necessary. Nitrogen fertilizers are now widely used throughout the world, and their production is a substantial segment of the chemical industry.          Liebig's work on applying chemistry to plant and animal physiology was especially influential. By 1842, he had published ""Chimie organique appliquée à la physiologie animale et à la pathologie"", published in English as "" Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology"", presenting a chemical theory of metabolism. The experimental techniques used by Liebig and others often involved controlling and measuring diet, and monitoring and analyzing the products of animal metabolism, as indicators of internal metabolic processes. Liebig saw similarities between plant and animal metabolism, and suggested that nitrogenous animal matter was similar to, and derived from, plant matter. He categorized foodstuffs into two groups, nitrogenous materials which he believed were used to build animal tissue, and non-nitrogenous materials which he believed were involved in separate processes of respiration and generation of heat.          French researchers such as Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Jean-Baptiste Boussingault believed that animals assimilated sugars, proteins, and fats from plant materials and lacked the ability to synthesize them. Liebig's work suggested a common ability of plants and animals to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. His experiments on fat metabolism convinced him that animals must be able to synthesize fats from sugars and starch. Other researchers built upon his work, confirming the abilities of animals to synthesize sugar and build fat.          Liebig also studied respiration, at one point measuring the ""ingesta and excreta"" of 855 soldiers, a bodyguard of the Grand Duke of Hessen-Darmstadt, for an entire month. He outlined an extremely speculative model of equations in which he attempted to explain how protein degradation might balance within a healthy body and result in pathological imbalances in cases of illness or inappropriate nutrition. This proposed model was justifiably criticized. Berzelius stingingly stated that ""this facile kind of physiological chemistry is created at the writing table"". Some of the ideas that Liebig had enthusiastically incorporated were not supported by further research. The third and last edition of ""Animal chemistry"" (1846) was substantially revised and did not include the equations.           The third area discussed in ""Animal Chemistry"" was fermentation and putrefaction. Liebig proposed chemical explanations for processes such as eremacausis (organic decomposition), describing the rearrangement of atoms as a result of unstable ""affinities"" reacting to external causes such as air or already decaying substances. Liebig identified the blood as the site of the body's ""chemical factory"", where he believed processes of synthesis and degradation took place. He presented a view of disease in terms of chemical process, in which healthy blood could be attacked by external contagia; secreting organs sought to transform and excrete such substances; and failure to do so could lead to their elimination through the skin, lungs, and other organs, potentially spreading contagion. Again, although the world was much more complicated than his theory, and many of his individual ideas were later proved wrong, Liebig managed to synthesize existing knowledge in a way that had significant implications for doctors, sanitarians and social reformers. The English medical journal ""The Lancet"" reviewed Liebig's work and translated his chemical lectures as part of its mission to establish a new era of medicine. Liebig's ideas stimulated significant medical research, led to the development of better techniques for testing experimental models of metabolism, and pointed to chemistry as fundamental to the understanding of health and disease.          In 1850 Liebig investigated spontaneous human combustion, dismissing the simplistic explanations based on ethanol due to alcoholism.          Liebig drew upon his work in plant nutrition and plant and animal metabolism to develop a theory of nutrition, which had significant implications for cookery. In his ""Researches on the chemistry of food"" (1847) Liebig argued that it was important to eat not only meat fibre, but also meat juices, which contained various inorganic chemicals. These vital ingredients would be lost during conventional boiling or roasting in which cooking liquids were discarded. For optimum nutritional quality, Liebig advised that cooks should either sear the meat initially to retain fluids, or retain and use cooking liquids (as in soups or stews).          Liebig was acclaimed in ""The Lancet"" for revealing ""the true principles of cookery"", and physicians promoted ""rational diets"" based on his ideas. Well-known British cookery writer Eliza Acton responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her ""Modern Cookery for Private Families"", and subtitling the edition accordingly. Liebig's idea that ""searing meat seals in the juices"", though still widely believed, is not true.          Building on his theories of the nutritional value of meat fluids, and seeking an inexpensive nutrition source for Europe’s poor, Liebig developed a formula for producing beef extract. The details were published in 1847 so that ""the benefit of it should ... be placed at the command of as large a number of persons as possible by the extension of the manufacture, and consequently a reduction in the cost"".          Production was not economically feasible in Europe, where meat was expensive, but in Uruguay and New South Wales meat was an inexpensive byproduct of the leather industry. In 1865, Liebig partnered with Belgian engineer George Christian Giebert, and was named scientific director of the Liebig's Extract of Meat Company, located in Fray Bentos, Uruguay.          Other companies also attempted to market meat extracts under the name ""Liebig's Extract of Meat"". In Britain, a competitor's right to use the name was successfully defended on the grounds that the name had fallen into general use and become a generic term before the creation of any particular company. The judge asserted that ""Purchasers must use their eyes"", and considered the presentation of the products to be sufficiently different to enable the discriminating consumer to determine which of the products bore Liebig's signature and was supported by Baron Liebig himself.          Liebig's company initially promoted their ""meat tea"" for its curative powers and nutritional value as a cheap, nutritious alternative to real meat. After claims of its nutritional value were questioned, they emphasized its convenience and flavour, marketing it as a comfort food. The Liebig company worked with popular cookery writers in various countries to popularize their products. German cookery writer Henriette Davidis wrote recipes for ""Improved and Economic Cookery"" and other cookbooks. Katherina Prato wrote an Austria-Hungarian recipe book, ""Die Praktische Verwerthung Kochrecepte"" (1879). Hannah M. Young was commissioned in England to write ""Practical Cookery Book"" for the Liebig Company. In the United States, Maria Parloa extolled the benefits of Liebig's extract. Colorful calendars and trading cards were also marketed to popularize the product.          The company also worked with English chemist Henry Enfield Roscoe to develop a related product which it registered some years after Liebig's death, under the ""Oxo"" trademark. Oxo was trademarked worldwide in 1899 and in the United Kingdom in 1900. Originally a liquid, Oxo was released in cubed solid form in 1911.          Liebig studied other foods as well. He promoted the use of baking powder to make lighter bread, studied the chemistry of coffee-making, and developed a breast milk substitute for babies who could not suckle. He is considered to have made possible the invention of Marmite, because of his discovery that yeast could be concentrated.          Liebig founded the journal ""Annalen der Chemie"", which he edited from 1832. Originally titled ""Annalen der Pharmacie"", it became ""Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie"" to more accurately reflect its content. It became the leading journal of Chemistry, and still exists. The volumes from his lifetime are often referenced just as ""Liebigs Annalen""; and following his death the title was officially changed to ""Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie"".          Liebig published widely in ""Liebigs Annalen"" and elsewhere, in newspapers as well as journals. Most of his books were published concurrently in both German and English, and many were translated into other languages as well. Some of his most influential titles include:          In addition to books and articles, he wrote thousands of letters, most of them to other scientists.          Liebig also played a direct role in the German publication of John Stuart Mill's ""Logic."" Through Liebig's close friendship with the Vieweg family publishing house, he arranged for his former student Jacob Schiel (1813–1889) to translate Mill's important work for German publication. Liebig liked Mill's ""Logic"" in part because it promoted science as a means to social and political progress, but also because Mill featured several examples of Liebig's research as an ideal for the scientific method. In this way, he sought to reform politics in the German states.          In 1852, Justus von Liebig accepted an appointment from King Maximilian II of Bavaria to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He also became scientific advisor to King Maxilimian II, who hoped to transform the University of Munich into a center for scientific research and development. In part, Liebig accepted the post because, at age 50, he was finding it increasingly difficult to supervise large numbers of laboratory students. His new accommodations in Munich reflected this shift in focus. They included a comfortable house suitable for extensive entertaining, a small laboratory, and a newly built lecture theatre capable of holding 300 people with a demonstration laboratory at the front. There he gave lectures to the university and fortnightly to the public. In his position as a promoter of science, Liebig was appointed president of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, becoming perpetual president of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1858.          Liebig enjoyed a personal friendship with Maximilian II, who died on 10 March 1864. After Maximilian's death, Liebig and other liberal Protestant scientists in Bavaria were increasingly opposed by ultramontane Catholics.          Liebig died in Munich in 1873, and is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.          Liebig was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1837.          He became a first class member of the Ludwig Order, founded by Ludwig I, and awarded by Ludwig II on 24 July 1837.          In 1838 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 he joined as foreign member.          The British Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal ""for his discoveries in organic chemistry, and particularly for his development of the composition and theory of organic radicals"" in 1840.          Ludwig II of Bavaria conveyed the title of Freiherr von Liebig on 29 December 1845. In English, the closest translation is ""Baron"".          In 1850, he received the French Légion d'honneur, presented by chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, the French trade minister.          He was honored with the Prussian Order of Merit for Science by Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia in 1851.          In 1869, he was awarded the Albert Medal by the Royal Society of Arts, ""for his numerous valuable researches and writings, which have contributed most importantly to the development of food-economy and agriculture, to the advancement of chemical science, and to the benefits derived from that science by Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce.""          In 1946, after the end of World War II, the University of Giessen was officially renamed after him, ""Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen"".          In 1953 the West German post office issued a stamp in his honor.          In 1953 the third General Assembly of the International Scientific Centre of Fertilizers (CIEC), founded in 1932, was organized in Darmstadt to honor Justus von Liebig on the 150 anniversary of his birth.          A portrait of Liebig hangs in the Burlington House headquarters of the Royal Society of Chemistry. It was presented to the society's forerunner, the Chemical Society, by his god-daughter Mrs Alec Tweedie, Ethel Brilliana Tweedie, Harley, daughter of Emma Muspratt.          Some organizations have granted medals in honor of Justus von Liebig. In 1871, the Versammlung deutscher Land- und Forstwirte (Assembly of German Farmers and Foresters) first awarded a Liebig Gold Medal, given to Theodor Reuning. The image was struck from a portrait commissioned in 1869 from Friedrich Brehmer.          For several years, the Liebig Trust Fund, established by Baron Liebig, was administered by the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences at Munich and members of the Liebig family. They were empowered to award gold and silver Liebig Medals to deserving German scientists ""for the purpose of encouraging research in agricultural science"". Silver medals could be awarded to scientists from other countries. Some of those who received medals include:          In 1903, the Verein deutscher Chemiker (Association of German Chemists) also had a medal struck using Brehmer's portrait. Their Liebig Medal was first awarded in 1903 to Adolf von Baeyer, and in 1904 to Dr. Rudolf Knietsch of the Badische Ani-lin und Soda-Fabrik. it continues to be awarded.          At the third World Congress of CIEC, held at Heidelberg in 1957, the ""Sprengel-Liebing Medal"" was awarded to Dr. E. Feisst, president of CIEC, for outstanding contributions in agricultural chemistry.","['1803 births', '1873 deaths', 'German chemists', 'German inventors', 'German scientists', 'Soil scientists', 'People from Darmstadt', 'People from the Grand Duchy of Hesse', 'Barons of Germany', 'University of Bonn alumni', 'University of Erlangen-Nuremberg alumni', 'University of Giessen faculty', 'Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich faculty', 'Recipients of the Copley Medal', 'Recipients of the Pour le M\xc3\xa9rite (civil class)', 'Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences', 'Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art', 'Burials at the Alter S\xc3\xbcdfriedhof', 'Members of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences', 'Justus von Liebig']"

658978,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=658978,Kents Cavern,"Kents Cavern is a cave system in Torquay, Devon, England. It is notable for its archaeological and geological features. The cave system is open to the public and has been a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1952 and a Scheduled Ancient Monument since 1957.          The caverns and passages were formed in the early Pleistocene period by water action, and have been occupied by one of at least eight separate, discontinuous native populations to have inhabited the British Isles. The other key paleolithic sites in the UK are Happisburgh, Pakefield, Boxgrove, Swanscombe, Pontnewydd, Paviland, and Gough's Cave.          A prehistoric maxilla (upper jawbone) fragment was discovered in the cavern during a 1927 excavation by the Torquay Natural History Society, and named ""Kents Cavern 4."" The specimen is on display at the Torquay Museum.          In 1989 the fragment was radiocarbon dated to 36,400–34,700 years BP, but a 2011 study that dated fossils from neighbouring strata produced an estimate of 44,200–41,500 years BP. The same study analysed the dental structure of the fragment and determined it to be ""Homo sapiens"" rather than ""Homo neanderthalensis"", thus making it the earliest anatomically modern human fossil yet discovered in northwestern Europe.          Maxilla Kent's Cavern 4, then the Gravettian Paviland 1 and Eel Point represents the oldest anatomically modern humans known from Britain.          Kents Cavern is first recorded as Kents Hole Close on a 1659 deed when the land was leased to John Black. The earliest evidence of exploration of the caves in historic times is two inscriptions, ""William Petre 1571"" and ""Robert Hedges 1688"" engraved on stalagmites. The first recorded excavation was that of Thomas Northmore in 1824. Northmore's work attracted the attention of William Buckland, the first Reader in Geology at the University of Oxford, who sent a party including John MacEnery to explore the caves in an attempt to find evidence that Mithras was once worshipped in the area. MacEnery, the Roman Catholic chaplain at Torre Abbey, conducted systematic excavations between 1824 and 1829. When MacEnery reported to the British Association the discovery of flint tools below the stalagmites on the cave floor, his work was derided as contrary to Bishop James Ussher's Biblical chronology dating the Creation to 4004 BC.          In September 1845 the recently-created Torquay Natural History Society requested permission from Sir Lawrence Palk to explore the caves to obtain fossils and artefacts for the planned Torquay Museum, and as a result Edward Vivian and William Pengelly were allowed to conduct excavations between 1846 and 1858. Vivian reported to the Geological Society in 1847, but at the time, it was generally believed that early humans had entered the caves long after the formation of the cave structures examined. This changed when in the Autumn of 1859, following the work of Pengelly at the Brixham Cavern and of Jacques de Perthes in France, the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the British Association agreed that the excavations had established the antiquity of humanity.          In 1865 the British Association created a committee, led by Pengelly, to fully explore the cave system over the course of fifteen years. It was Pengelly's party that discovered Robert Hedges' stalagmite inscription, and from the stalagmite's growth since that time deduced that human-created artefacts found under the formation could be half a million years old. Pengelly plotted the position of every bone, flint, and other artefact he discovered during the excavations, and afterward continued working with the Torquay Natural History Society until his death in 1892 at his home less than 2 km from the caves.          In 1903 Kents Cavern, then part of Lord Haldon's estate, was sold to Francis Powe, a carpenter who originally used the caves as a workshop while making beach huts for the Torquay sea front. Powe's son, Leslie Powe, turned the caves into a tourist attraction by laying concrete paths, installing electric lighting, and building visitor facilities that later were improved, in turn, by his son John Powe. The caves, now owned by Nick Powe, celebrated 100 years of Powe family ownership on 23 August 2003 with special events including an archæological dig for children and a display by a cave rescue team. A year later a new £500,000 visitor centre was opened, including a restaurant and gift shop.          Attracting 80,000 tourists a year, Kents Cavern is an important tourist attraction and this was recognised in 2000 when it was awarded Showcave of the Year award and later in November 2005 when it was awarded a prize for being Torquay's Visitor Attraction of the year.          ""Hampsley Cavern"" in Agatha Christie's 1924 novel ""The Man in the Brown Suit"", is based on Kents Cavern. The 2011 science fiction romance ""Time Watchers: The Greatest of These"", by Julie Reilly, uses Kents Cavern as a principal setting in three different time periods.","['Archaeological sites in Devon', 'Caves of Devon', 'Geology of Devon', 'Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Devon', 'Show caves in the United Kingdom', 'Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Devon', 'Stone Age sites in England', 'Torquay', 'Paleoanthropological sites']"

8084684,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8084684,K. Thamboosamy Pillay,"K. Thamboosamy Pillay (Tamil: தம்புசாமி பிள்ளை) was a prominent Malaysian of Tamil origin during the pre-independence years. He was considered the leader of the Tamil community. He was a wealthy businessman, tin miner, moneylender and government contractor.          Thamboosamy was one of the founders and one of the original Trustees of Victoria Institution as well as the founder of the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur.          Born in Singapore in 1850, K. Thamboosamy Pillay received his early education at Raffles Institution. He sailed to Klang in 1875 with James Guthrie Davidson, when the latter was appointed Malaya's first British Resident. Prior to that, he had been a clerk in the legal firm in which Davidson was a partner.          He was later transferred to the Treasury where he eventually became chief clerk and acted as State Treasurer on a few occasions. He was sent to India by the Malayan Government to bring over the first batch of Indian immigrants for the Railway and Public Works. Thamboosamy resigned from Government service in the 1880s and, going into partnership with towkay Loke Yew, managed the New Tin Mining Company in Rawang. They were the first to use electric pumps for mining in Malaya.          A Justice of Peace and member of the prestigious KL Sanitary Board, Thamboosamy was the acknowledged leader of the Tamil community. His other business interests included coffee planting, real estate and construction. He constructed part of the main road from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Kubu. He was a member of both the Selangor Club and the Turf Club and owned several horses.          Thamboosamy died in 1902 in Singapore, where he had gone to attend a meeting at the Singapore Turf Club.          A Justice of Peace and member of the prestigious KL Sanitary Board, Thamboosamy was the acknowledged leader of the Indian community in Malaya, especially in Kuala Lumpur.          Thamboosamy was one of the founders and one of the original Trustees of Victoria Institution. One of the sports houses in VI is named after him. His son, K. T. Ganapathy Pillay, was a Victorian and served as the second President of the VIOBA.          The Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur was founded by Thamboosamy in 1873 and was initially used as a private shrine by the Pillai family. The family threw open the temple doors to the public in the late 1920s and eventually handed the management of the temple over to a board of trustees.          This is the oldest functioning Hindu temple in Malaysia. It is also reputed to be the richest in the country. The Temple was originally sited somewhere near the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. It shifted to its present location along Jalan Tun H.S. Lee (next to KL's Chinatown) in 1885.          He was also said to have discovered Batu Caves, with its ""vel""-shaped entrance, and was inspired to start a Hindu temple in devotion to Lord Muruga.          So great was Thamboosamy's philanthropic spirit, that he donated money to whoever needed it, regardless of race or religion. He contributed a sizeable amount of money to the building fund of St. Mary's Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur in 1893, despite being a Hindu.          A street in the Chow Kit district and a Tamil primary school in Sentul are also named in his memory.","['1850 births', '1902 deaths', 'Malaysian businesspeople', 'Malaysian people of Indian descent', 'Tamil businesspeople', 'Businesspeople of Indian descent', 'Malaysian Hindus']"
3256220,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3256220,Robert Gardner (footballer),"Robert Gardner (31 March 1847 – 28 February 1887) was an important figure in Scottish football history. He was a match arranger, goalkeeper and team captain for Queen's Park during the 1860s until 1874. A letter of his, dated 1868, is the oldest surviving letter pertaining to association football. He was also the first goalkeeper to captain an international side.          Gardner was born in Glasgow and brought up in the city. Pictures show that he wore a full beard. He was evidently very well educated. According to a contemporary cartoon, he may have relieved the boredom of long periods of inactivity by smoking his pipe on the field. He married Mary Arrol, cousin of the engineer Sir William Arrol, and they had three sons. He found work on Sir William Arrol's Forth Bridge project at South Queensferry, where he died, before he was 40, on 28 February 1887.          Gardner was one of the original members of Queen's Park Football Club. He was originally a forward but switched to goalkeeper in 1872. Apart from four goals conceded in an international match in 1873, Gardner did not concede a goal until January 1874. This is considered phenomenal when one considers that he may not have been allowed to use his hands for much of that time, and that goalkeeping technique would have been in a primitive state. However, although nineteenth century goalkeeping seems to have been almost entirely ""on the goal line"", the basic stalwart technique of ""narrowing the angle"" seems to have been used by Gardner. He was almost certainly the best goalkeeper of his time.          Gardner was instrumental in arranging the first official international football match, Scotland versus England in 1872, called by many ""the most important game in football history"", because the English played a style based on individual dribbling, while the Scots played a passing style; and the rules for the match were standardised (the Scottish rules). The Scottish side for this match consisted entirely of Queen's Park players. Robert Gardner was Scotland's first ever team captain, who selected his team, and kept goal during most of the 0–0 draw, although during the early stages of the second half he swapped places with forward Robert Smith and played part of the match up front before returning to the goal.          Gardner kept goal and captained Scotland against England the following year. The game was won 4–2 by England in London against a Scottish side which was partly composed of English-based players because the Scottish Football Association budget only stretched to the rail fares of seven players.          Gardner's switch of club to Clydesdale in 1874 lost him the Scottish captaincy when the Queen's Park players refused to be captained by a player from another club. He still kept goal for Scotland against England for the following two years, with a 2–1 win and a 2–2 draw. Gardner kept goal and captained Clydesdale in the first Scottish cup final in 1874, playing against Queen's Park. Although his side lost 2–0, contemporary accounts of the match home in on Gardner's magnificent display of goalkeeping against his old club.          In 1878 he made his fifth and last appearance as Scotland's last line of defence, and had the satisfaction of taking part in Scotland's 7–2 drubbing of England. Gardner also served as referee, handling the first international match between Scotland and Wales on 25 March 1876, and was a founding member of the Scottish Football Association serving as its President from 1877 to 1878.","['1847 births', '1887 deaths', 'Sportspeople from Glasgow', 'Scottish footballers', 'Scotland international footballers', 'Association football goalkeepers', ""Queen's Park F.C. players"", 'Clydesdale F.C. players']"
308577,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308577,John Turturro,"John Michael Turturro () (born February 28, 1957) is an Italian-American actor, writer and director known for his roles in the films ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989), ""Miller's Crossing"" (1990), ""Barton Fink"" (1991), ""Quiz Show"" (1994), ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000) and the first three films in the ""Transformers"" film series (2007–2011). He has appeared in over sixty films, and has worked frequently with the Coen brothers, Adam Sandler and Spike Lee.          An Emmy Award winner, Turturro has also been nominated for three Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Golden Globe Award.          Turturro was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Katherine, an amateur jazz singer who worked in a Navy yard during World War II, and Nicholas Turturro, a carpenter and construction worker who fought as a Navy sailor on D-Day. Turturro's mother was Sicilian (from Aragona near Agrigento) and his father immigrated from Giovinazzo, Bari, Italy at the age of six. Turturro was raised a Roman Catholic and moved to the Rosedale section of Queens, New York with his family when he was six. He majored in Theatre Arts at the State University of New York at New Paltz, and completed his MFA at the Yale School of Drama.          Turturro's first film appearance was a non-speaking extra role in Martin Scorsese's critically acclaimed ""Raging Bull"" (1980). He created the title role of John Patrick Shanley's ""Danny and the Deep Blue Sea"" at the Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in 1983. He repeated it the following year Off-Broadway and won an Obie Award.          Spike Lee liked Turturro's performance in ""Five Corners"" so much that he cast him in ""Do the Right Thing"". This movie was the first of a long-standing collaboration between the director and Turturro, which includes work together on a total of nine films—more than any other actor in the Lee oeuvre-- including ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990), ""Jungle Fever"" (1991), ""Clockers"" (1995), ""Girl 6"" (1996), ""He Got Game"" (1998), ""Summer of Sam"" (1999), ""She Hate Me"" (2004), and ""Miracle at St. Anna"" (2008).          Turturro has appeared in both comedy and drama films, and engaged in an extended collaboration with the Coen Brothers—he appeared in their films ""Miller's Crossing"" (1990), ""Barton Fink"" (1991), ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000). He has also appeared in several of Adam Sandler's movies, such as ""Mr. Deeds"" (2002) and ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" (2008). He played a severely disturbed patient of Jack Nicholson's character in the comedy ""Anger Management"" and played Johnny Depp's character's antagonist in ""Secret Window"". Turturro hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1994, where he spoofed his then-recently made film, ""Quiz Show"", being told he was ineligible to host unless he answered questions in a booth and if he failed, the honor of hosting would go to Joey Buttafuoco, who was actually backstage to witness Turturro's test. He won an Emmy award for his portrayal of Adrian Monk's brother Ambrose in the USA Network series ""Monk"", and reprised the role on numerous occasions. He has also been nominated and won many awards from film organizations such as Screen Actors Guild, Cannes Film Festival, Golden Globes and others.          Turturro produced and directed, as well as acted in, the film ""Illuminata"" (1999), which also starred his wife, actress Katherine Borowitz. He wrote and directed the film ""Romance and Cigarettes"" (2005). In 2006 he appeared in Robert De Niro's ""The Good Shepherd"", and as the Sector 7 agent Simmons in three films of the ""Transformers"" live-action series. In 2010 he directed (and had cameo on-screen appearances in) ""Passione"", which chronicles the rich musical heritage of Naples, Italy.          His stage directorial debut was in October 2011, with the Broadway play ""Relatively Speaking"", in which he guided an ensemble of veteran actors in a production of three comedic one-act plays, written by Elaine May, Woody Allen and Ethan Coen. The cast included Julie Kavner, Marlo Thomas, Mark Linn-Baker and Steve Guttenberg.          Turturro's fifth directorial film ""Fading Gigolo"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in mid-September 2013. Turturro also acts in the film alongside Woody Allen, who played a novice pimp overseeing the sex work of Turturro's character. During a September 2013 interview, Turturro expressed his intention to draw parallels between sex work and acting, explaining that the latter is a ""service business"" in which actors are ""acting out people's wishes or fantasies."" In March 2014, Turturro received the Career Achievement tribute and award at the 31st Edition of the Miami International Film Festival at the Olympia Theater in Downtown Miami.          Turturro's brother is actor Nicholas Turturro. Artist Ralph Turturro, composer and film director Richard Termini and actress Aida Turturro are his cousins. He has two sons: Amedeo (born 1990) and Diego (born 2000), with his wife, actress Katherine Borowitz.          Turturro participates as a member of the Jury for the NYICFF, a local New York City Film Festival dedicated to screening films for children between the ages of 3 and 18. In January 2011, Turturro received his Italian passport, and holds dual Italian and U.S. citizenship.","['1957 births', 'American people of Italian descent', 'American people of Sicilian descent', '20th-century American male actors', '21st-century American male actors', 'Male actors from New York City', 'American male film actors', 'American film directors', 'American male screenwriters', 'American male stage actors', 'American male television actors', 'David di Donatello winners', 'Film directors from New York City', 'Italian male film actors', 'Italian film directors', 'Italian screenwriters', 'Italian male stage actors', 'Italian male television actors', 'Living people', 'Male actors of Italian descent', 'Obie Award recipients', 'People from Brooklyn', 'People from Queens, New York', 'People of Apulian descent', 'Primetime Emmy Award winners', 'State University of New York at New Paltz alumni', 'Yale School of Drama alumni']"
422786,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422786,Primorial,"In mathematics, and more particularly in number theory, primorial is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers similar to the factorial function, but rather than successively multiplying positive integers, only prime numbers are multiplied.          There are two conflicting definitions that differ in the interpretation of the argument: the first interprets the argument as an index into the sequence of prime numbers (so that the function is strictly increasing), while the second interprets the argument as a bound on the prime numbers to be multiplied (so that the function value at any composite number is the same as at its predecessor). The rest of this article uses the latter interpretation.          The name ""primorial"", attributed to Harvey Dubner, draws an analogy to ""primes"" the same way the name ""factorial"" relates to ""factors"".          For the ""n""th prime number ""p"" the primorial ""p#"" is defined as the product of the first ""n"" primes:          where ""p"" is the ""k""th prime number.          For instance, ""p#"" signifies the product of the first 5 primes:          The first six primorials ""p#"" are:          The sequence also includes ""p#"" = 1 as empty product.          Asymptotically, primorials ""p#"" grow according to:          where formula_4 is the little-o notation.          In general, for a positive integer ""n"" such a primorial ""n#"" can also be defined, namely as the product of those primes ≤ ""n"":          where, formula_6 is the prime-counting function , giving the number of primes ≤ ""n"".          This is equivalent to:          For example, 12# represents the product of those primes ≤ 12:          Since formula_9, this can be calculated as:          Consider the first 12 primorials ""n""#:          We see that for composite ""n"" every term n# simply duplicates the preceding term (""n"" − 1)#, as given in the definition. In the above example we have that 12# = ""p""# = 11#, since 12 is a composite number.          The natural logarithm of ""n""# is the first Chebyshev function, written formula_11 or formula_12, which approaches the linear ""n"" for large ""n"".          Primorials ""n""# grow according to:          The idea of multiplying all known primes occurs in some proofs of the infinitude of the prime numbers, where it is used to derive the existence of another prime.          Primorials play a role in the search for prime numbers in additive arithmetic progressions. For instance, 2236133941 + 23# results in a prime, beginning a sequence of thirteen primes found by repeatedly adding 23#, and ending with 5136341251. 23# is also the common difference in arithmetic progressions of fifteen and sixteen primes.          Every highly composite number is a product of primorials (e.g. 360 = 2·6·30).          Primorials are all square-free integers, and each one has more distinct prime factors than any number smaller than it. For each primorial ""n"", the fraction formula_14 is smaller than for any lesser integer, where formula_15 is the Euler totient function.          Any completely multiplicative function is defined by its values at primorials, since it is defined by its values at primes, which can be recovered by division of adjacent values.          Base systems corresponding to primorials (such as base 30, not to be confused with the primorial number system) have a lower proportion of repeating fractions than any smaller base.

36545635,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36545635,Schleswig Coldblood,"The Schleswig Coldblood () is a breed of medium-sized draught horse originally from the historic Schleswig region of the Jutland Peninsula, which today is divided between modern Denmark and Germany, and from which its name derives. It is found primarily in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, and also, in smaller numbers, in Lower Saxony. It shares the origins, ancestry and much of the history of the Danish Jutland breed, and shows some similarity to the British Suffolk Punch. It was bred as a working horse for agriculture and forestry; today it is used mostly to pull coaches, wagons and drays.          The Schleswig Coldblood originates from the area of the Duchy of Schleswig, in the southern part of the Jutland Peninsula, and has its origins in the Jutland horse. In about 1860 an imported English stallion, Oppenheim LXII, either a pure-bred or a part-bred Suffolk Punch, was introduced, and became the foundation stallion of the breed. In 1888 the breeding of warmbloods and coldbloods was separated, and in 1891 various associations of coldblood breeders in Schleswig were brought together in the , and systematic breeding began. The brand V.S.P in an oval on the off hindleg was chosen to identify registered horses and is still used today.          In 1893 the stallion Aldrup Munkedal 839 was born, a son of Munkedal II 585 and a descendant of Oppenheim LXII; he won the king's prize at the Jubilee celebrations in Odense in 1900, and 70,000 crowns were offered for him. From after the First World War all Schleswig Coldbloods descended from this stallion.          By 1910 the Verband recorded 12,000 breeding animals. Through regional agricultural shows, the Schleswig Coldblood became widely known and was sold throughout Germany. The division of Schleswig between Denmark and Germany in 1920, in the aftermath of the First World War, meant the loss of a large part of the breeding area and was a major setback. However numbers rose again, and in 1949 reached a peak of about 450 stallions and 20,000 or 25,000 brood mares in the hands of more than 15,000 breeders spread throughout Schleswig-Holstein, though more concentrated in the north. In 1958 two French stallions were added to the breeding stock.          In the years following the Second World War the mechanisation of agriculture, with the replacement of agricultural horses with tractors, led to a dramatic decline in numbers. By 1976 they had fallen to a low of 35 mares and 5 stallions, and in that year the old society was dissolved and the remaining animals were registered in the Schleswig-Holstein horse register in Kiel. A society for the protection of the breed was soon formed, and in 1991 this became the , or Schleswig horse breeders' association. The society has 200 members.          Since 1997 numbers have remained stable at about 200–250; in 2013 there were 189 mares and 26 stallions. The Schleswig Coldblood was listed as ""endangered"" by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations in 2007. In 2013 it was in Category II: ""seriously endangered"" on the Rote Liste of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen, the German national association for the conservation of historic and endangered domestic animal breeds, and was listed as ""minimally endangered"" by the European Association for Animal Production (EAAP).          Since 2012 a sub-population, the , or roughly ""Hanoverian coldblood of Schleswig origin"", has been included in the Schleswiger Coldblood breed; in 2012 there were a total of 62, 4 stallions and 58 mares.          The Schleswig Coldblood stands between (61–64 in) and weighs about . Stallions are often taller than mares. It has a short and straight head with kind eyes and a broad forehead; short, cresty neck; powerful shoulders; a long body with good depth in the girth; powerful hindquarters; short and stocky limbs with some feather. It is predominantly chestnut in colour though occasionally bay or grey. The Schleswig Coldblood is a good mover and has a placid nature. It is versatile and agile, with great endurance and very willing to learn.          The Schleswig Coldblood was bred for use as a working horse. It was used on farms and for hauling timber from forests, to pull omnibuses and brewery wagons in cities and for heavy work in the military. Today, they are still seen as working horses in the agriculture and timber industries, as well as used for various forms of recreational use, including driving and pulling wagonettes.","['Horse breeds', 'Horse breeds originating in Germany', 'Animal breeds on the GEH Red List']"

Monrad's father, Otto Sommer Monrad, an attorney, suffered from mental illness, and spent some years in institutions; he died in 1863.          Monrad studied theology and became a Lutheran minister, while beginning to participate in politics. He became editor of the Liberal publication, ""Foedrelandet"", in 1840, and was leader of the National Liberal Party and spearheaded the movement towards a constitutional Denmark after 1848, the year in which he became a bishop. In the following year, he became a member of Parliament and was Minister of Church Affairs in the new government.          As Council President (1863-1864), he was the Danish state leader during the early part of Second Schleswig War, against the German Confederation led by Otto von Bismarck, which resulted in the Peace of Vienna.          After this war, a depressed and disillusioned Monrad emigrated to New Zealand. After sending his sons to Nelson and other districts of New Zealand to scout for land, he chose to settle in Palmerston North in the North Island of New Zealand. He bought of land at Karere Block. He first lived in a small hut and then erected a timber house and started clearing bushland. He and his family farmed cows and sheep.          Monrad helped the New Zealand Company to find suitable settlers from Scandinavia and helped many Danish immigrants find land to settle on, most notably in the area of Dannevirke.          His work was disturbed by Māori rioters, members of the Hauhau cult under Chief Titokowaru. Monrad buried his belongings and went with the family to Wellington and then went back to Denmark in 1869. His sons Viggo and Johannes later returned to Karere to become farmers.          Before leaving New Zealand, he presented to the New Zealand government a precious collection of sketches and etchings by old European masters such as Rembrandt, Rubens, Albrecht Dürer and van Dyck. They are now part of the collection at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and are occasionally on display there.

The album was Wilson's first album recorded after she left the last line-up of the Supremes which included herself, Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene. The Supremes had released their 29th and last studio album, ""Mary, Scherrie & Susaye"", in October 1976, just nine months before they officially disbanded as a group. During June 1977, Wilson decided to leave the Supremes (who were managed by her then-husband Pedro Ferrer at the time). Prior to her husband becoming the manager of the group, Wilson and Berry Gordy had an argument backstage at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas in 1970 (the same night Diana Ross made her farewell performance with the group to start a solo career). The argument started when Gordy had wanted to replace Jean Terrell (who was already chosen to take Ross's place as lead) with Syreeta Wright. Finally deciding to put her foot down against Gordy, Wilson refused to let Wright take Terrell's place, leading Gordy to state that he was washing his hands of the group, leaving Wilson and her husband to manage the group and keep the group's career alive.          Wilson had decided to begin a solo career after all three members could not agree on the Supremes' musical direction, leaving Payne and Greene to try - unsuccessfully - to find a replacement for Wilson.          Upon leaving the Supremes, Wilson became involved in a protracted legal battle with Motown Records over its management of the Supremes. After an out-of-court settlement, she signed a solo record deal with Motown. Originally, Marvin Gaye was scheduled to produce the album. However, Gaye was preoccupied with his divorce from Berry Gordy's elder sister Anna Gordy at the time, thus leaving her to work with Hal Davis who produced some of The Supremes earlier material as well as having worked with The Jackson 5 and with Michael Jackson on his early solo albums for Motown.          The album was a commercial failure and did not chart. Its lead single, ""Red Hot"", squeaked into the ""Billboard"" R&B singles chart at #95. Another single, ""Pick Up the Pieces"", failed to chart at all. An extended version of ""Red Hot"" was made available as a 12-inch single and reached #85 on the disco charts in October 1979.          After the release of ""Mary Wilson"", Wilson began working on her second solo album for Motown with English record producer Gus Dudgeon (who had already produced 4 new tracks for the new album). However, midway through the production of the album, Motown dropped Wilson from their roster in 1980.          Wilson's next album, ""Walk the Line"", would take some 13-years before finally seeing a release in 1992.","['1979 debut albums', 'Motown albums', 'Mary Wilson (singer) albums']"

17798882,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17798882,China–Vietnam relations,"The bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam have been turbulent, despite their common socialist background. Centuries of conquest by modern China's imperial predecessor have given Vietnam an entrenched suspicion of Chinese attempts to dominate it. Though the PRC assisted North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, relations between the two nations soured following Vietnam's reunification in 1975. China and Vietnam fought a prolonged border war from 1979 to 1990, but have since worked to improve their diplomatic and economic ties. However, the two countries remain in dispute over territorial issues in the South China Sea. A 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 84% of Vietnamese were concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries could lead to a military conflict.          China and Vietnam have interacted since the Chinese Warring States period and the Vietnamese Thục Dynasty of the 3rd century BC, as noted in the Vietnamese historical record ""Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư"". Between the 1st century BC and 15th century AD, Vietnam was subject to four separate periods of imperial Chinese domination, although it successfully asserted a degree of independence following the Battle of Bạch Đằng in 938 AD.          According to old Vietnamese historical records Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư and Khâm Định Việt Sử Thông Giám Cương Mục, An Dương Vương (Thục Phán) was a prince of the Chinese state of Shu (蜀, which shares the same Chinese character as his surname Thục), sent by his father first to explore what are now the southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Yunnan and second to move their people to modern-day northern Vietnam during the invasion of the Qin Dynasty.          Some modern Vietnamese believe that Thục Phán came upon the Âu Việt territory (modern-day northernmost Vietnam, western Guangdong, and southern Guangxi province, with its capital in what is today Cao Bằng Province). After assembling an army, he defeated King Hùng Vương XVIII, the last ruler of the Hồng Bàng Dynasty, in 258 BC. He proclaimed himself An Dương Vương (""King An Dương""). He then renamed his newly acquired state from Văn Lang to Âu Lạc and established the new capital at Phong Khê in the present-day Phú Thọ town in northern Vietnam, where he tried to build Cổ Loa Citadel), the spiral fortress approximately ten miles north of that new capital.          Han Chinese migration into Vietnam dated back to the era of 2nd century BC when Qin Shi Huang first placed northern Vietnam under Chinese rule, Chinese soldiers and fugitives from Central China migrated en masse into northern Vietnam from this time onwards, and introduced Chinese influences into Vietnamese culture. The Chinese military leader Zhao Tuo founded the Triệu dynasty which ruled Nanyue in southern China and northern Vietnam. The Qin Governor of Canton advisted Zhao to found his own independent Kingdom since the area was remote and there were many Chinese settlers in the area. The Chinese prefect of Jiaozhi Shi Xie ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese Emperors. Shi Xie was the leader of the elite ruling class of Han Chinese families who immigrated to Vietnam and played a major role in developing Vietnam's culture.          In 1884, during the time of Vietnam's Nguyễn Dynasty, Qing China and France fought a war which ended in a Chinese defeat. The resulting Treaty of Tientsin recognized French dominance over Vietnam and Indochina, spelling the end of formal Chinese influence on Vietnam, and the beginning of Vietnam's French colonial period.          Both China and Vietnam faced invasion and occupation by Imperial Japan during World War II, while Vietnam languished under the rule of the pro-Nazi Vichy French. In the Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong, Vietnamese revolutionaries led by Phan Bội Châu had arranged alliances with the Chinese nationalist Kuomintang prior to the war by marrying Vietnamese women to Chinese officers. Their children were at an advantage, since they could speak both languages, and they worked as agents for the revolutionaries, spreading revolutionary ideologies across borders. This intermarriage between Chinese and Vietnamese was viewed with alarm by the French. In addition, Chinese merchants married Vietnamese women, and provided funds and help for revolutionary agents.          Late in the war, with Japan and Nazi Germany nearing defeat, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt privately decided that the French should not reacquire their colonial property of French Indochina after the war was over. Roosevelt offered the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek the entirety of Indochina to be put under Chinese rule. Reportedly, Chiang Kai-shek replied: ""Under no circumstances!"". In August 1943, China broke diplomatic relations with the Vichy France regime, with the ""Central Daily News"" announcing diplomatic relations were to be solely between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, with no French intermediary. China had planned to widely spread the propaganda of the Atlantic Charter and Roosevelt's statement on Vietnamese self-determination, in order to undermine French authority in Indochina.          However, Roosevelt switched his position on Vietnamese independence in order to gain the support of Free French Forces in Europe.          After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General Lu Han were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to Indochina north of the 16th parallel, with the aim of accepting the surrender of Japanese occupying forces. These troops remained in Indochina until 1946. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war to force them to negotiate with the Vietminh leader Ho Chi Minh. In February 1946, Chiang Kai-shek forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and renounce their extraterritorial privileges, in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region.          Along with the Soviet Union, Communist China was an important strategic ally of North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The Chinese Communist Party provided arms, military training and essential supplies to help the Communist North defeat South Vietnam and its ally, the United States, between 1954 and 1975. However, the Vietnamese Communists remained suspicious of China's perceived attempts to increase its influence over Vietnam.          Vietnam was an ideological battleground of the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. After the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping secretly promised the North Vietnamese 1 billion yuan in military and economic aid, on the condition that they refused all Soviet aid.          During the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese and the Chinese had agreed to defer tackling their territorial issues until South Vietnam was defeated. These issues included the lack of delineation of Vietnam's territorial waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, and the question of sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. During the 1950s, half of the Paracels were controlled by China and half by South Vietnam. In 1958, North Vietnam accepted China's claim to the Paracels, relinquishing its own claim; one year earlier, China had ceded White Dragon Tail Island to North Vietnam. The potential of offshore oil deposits in the Gulf of Tonkin heightened tensions between China and South Vietnam. In 1973, with the Vietnam War drawing to a close, North Vietnam announced its intention to allow foreign companies to explore oil deposits in disputed waters. In January 1974, a clash between Chinese and South Vietnamese forces resulted in China taking complete control of the Paracels. After its absorption of South Vietnam in 1975, North Vietnam took over the South Vietnamese-controlled portions of the Spratly Islands. The unified Vietnam then canceled its earlier renunciation of its claim to the Paracels, while both China and Vietnam claim control over all the Spratlys, while both controlling portions of the island group.          In the wake of the Vietnam War, the Cambodian–Vietnamese War provoked tensions with China, which had allied itself with the Democratic Kampuchea. This, and Vietnam's close ties to the Soviet Union, made China consider it a threat to its regional sphere of influence. Tensions were furthermore heightened in the 1970s by the Vietnamese government's oppression of the Hoa minority, which consists of Vietnamese of Chinese ethnicity. By 1978, China ended its aid to Vietnam, which had signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, establishing extensive commercial and military ties.          On February 17, 1979, the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Vietnamese border, withdrawing on March 5 after a two-week campaign which devastated northern Vietnam and briefly threatened the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. Both sides suffered relatively heavy losses with thousands of casualties. Subsequent peace talks broke down in December 1979, and both China and Vietnam began a major build-up of forces along the border. Vietnam fortified its border towns and districts and stationed as many as 600,000 troops; China stationed approximately 400,000 troops on its side of the border. Sporadic fighting on the border occurred throughout the 1980s, and China threatened to launch another attack to force Vietnam's exit from Cambodia.          With the collapse of the Soviet Union and Vietnam's exit from Cambodia in 1990, Sino-Vietnamese ties began improving. Both nations planned the normalization of their relations in a secret summit in Chengdu in September 1990, and officially normalized ties in November 1991. Since 1991, the leaders and high-ranking officials of both nations have exchanged visits. China and Vietnam both recognized and supported the post-1991 government of Cambodia, and supported each other's bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1999, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Le Kha Phieu, visited Beijing, where he met General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin and announced a joint ""16 Word Guideline"" for improved bilateral relations; a Joint Statement for Comprehensive Cooperation was issued in 2000. In 2000, Vietnam and China successfully resolved longstanding disputes over their land border and maritime rights in the Gulf of Tonkin. A joint agreement between China and ASEAN in 2002 marked out a process of peaceful resolution and guarantees against armed conflict. In 2002, Jiang Zemin made an official visit to Vietnam, where numerous agreements were signed to expand trade and cooperation and resolve outstanding disputes.          After both sides resumed trade links in 1991, growth in annual bilateral trade increased from only US$32 million in 1991 to almost USD $7.2 billion in 2004. By 2011, the trade volume had reached USD $25 billion. It is predicted that China will become Vietnam's largest single trading partner, overtaking the United States, by 2030. China's transformation into a major economic power in the 21st century has led to an increase of foreign investments in the bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.          Vietnam's exports to China include crude oil, coal, coffee and food, while China exports pharmaceuticals, machinery, petroleum, fertilizers and automobile parts to Vietnam. China has become Vietnam's second-largest trading partner and the largest source of imports. Both nations are working to establish an ""economic corridor"" from China's Yunnan province to Vietnam's northern provinces and cities, and similar economic zones linking China's Guangxi province with Vietnam's Lạng Sơn and Quang Ninh provinces, and the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. Air and sea links as well as a railway line have been opened between the two countries, along with national-level seaports in the frontier provinces and regions of the two countries. Joint ventures have furthermore been launched, such as the Thai Nguyen Steel Complex, which produces hundreds of thousands of tonnes of steel products.          In June 2011, Vietnam announced that its military would conduct new exercises in the South China Sea. China had previously voiced its disagreement over Vietnamese oil exploration in the area, stating that the Spratly Islands and the surrounding waters were its sovereign territory. Defense of the South China Sea was cited as one of the possible missions of the first Chinese aircraft carrier, the ""Liaoning"", which entered service in September 2012.          In October 2011, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, made an official visit to China at the invitation of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Hu Jintao, with the aim of improving bilateral relations in the wake of the border disputes. However, on 21 June 2012, Vietnam passed a law entitled the Law on the Sea, which placed both the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands under Vietnamese jurisdiction, prompting China to label the move as ""illegal and invalid"". Simultaneously, China passed a law establishing the prefecture of Sansha City, which encompassed the Xisha (Paracel), Zhongsha, and Nansha (Spratly) Islands and the surrounding waters. Vietnam proceeded to strongly oppose the measure and reaffirmed its sovereignty over the islands. Other countries surrounding the South China Sea have claims to the two island chains, including Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines; nonetheless, the conflict remains predominantly between Vietnam and China.          In May 2013 Vietnam accused the PRC of hitting one of its fishing boats, while in May 2014 Vietnam accused China of ramming and sinking a fishing boat.          In June 2014 China declared there would be no military conflict with Vietnam as the two were sparring over an oil rig in disputed territory in the South China Sea. China at the time had 71 ships in the disputed area while Vietnam had 61.","['Bilateral relations of Vietnam', 'Bilateral relations of China', 'Economy of Yunnan', 'China\xe2\x80\x93Vietnam relations']"
25275931,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25275931,EJ Manuel,"Erik Rodriguez ""EJ"" Manuel, Jr. (born March 19, 1990) is an American football quarterback for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Bills in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft.          Manuel was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended Bayside High School Virginia Beach, where he played for the Bayside Marlins high school football team. His father, Erik, was childhood friends with NFL Hall of Fame defensive end Bruce Smith. In 2004, as a freshman, he started at quarterback and threw for 589 yards and seven touchdowns, as well as rushing for 219 yards and one touchdown. As a sophomore, he recorded 1,332 passing yards and eight touchdowns as well as 276 rushing yards and six touchdowns. As a junior, Manuel threw for 1,973 yards and 15 touchdowns while rushing for 345 yards and five touchdowns. In 2007, as a senior, Manuel passed for 1,859 yards, 18 touchdowns and rushed for 541 yards. He was considered a five-star recruit by Scout, a four star recruit by Rivals and both sites, as well as ""Sports Illustrated"", listed him the second best quarterback. He was an All-American quarterback in high school.          Manuel enrolled in Florida State University, where he played for coach Bobby Bowden and coach Jimbo Fisher's Florida State Seminoles football teams from 2008 to 2012. While he was a student, he joined the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. Manuel became the second collegiate quarterback to win four straight bowl games, the first being Pat White of West Virginia.          Manuel took over for an injured Christian Ponder as the 4-5 Seminoles were in danger of finishing with a losing record for the first time since Bowden took over the program. His first start was an away game against Wake Forest. He completed 15 of 20 passes for 220 yards with one touchdown, leading the Seminoles to a 41-28 win over Wake Forest, who at the time had won three games in a row against Florida State. Manuel struggled in his second game against Maryland but still managed to pull out a much needed win making FSU bowl-eligible. Manuel's struggles continued against the dominating Florida Gators, and the mobile quarterback wasn't able to get into a rhythm as Florida State lost, 37-10.          Florida State entered the Gator Bowl 6-6 and in serious danger of letting legendary coach Bobby Bowden leave with a losing record. Manuel led Florida State to a 33-21 victory over the West Virginia Mountaineers and won the Gator Bowl MVP honors.          Manuel started twice in the 2010 season for Christian Ponder, who battled a nagging forearm injury. In his first start against Clemson, he picked up 71 yards on 15 carries. He also led the Seminoles to a victory in the 2010 Chick-fil-A Bowl against South Carolina when Christian Ponder was injured in the second quarter of the game.          In the 2011 season, EJ Manuel played in every game besides the loss at Clemson after injuring his shoulder in a loss against Oklahoma the previous week. He finished the season with 2,666 yards passing on a 65% completion rate. He also finished with 18 passing touchdowns, 4 rushing touchdowns, and 8 interceptions. He helped lead the Seminoles to a comeback win against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the Champs Sports Bowl by throwing for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns.          Manuel led the Seminoles to numerous wins over ACC rivals, an ACC Championship, and an Orange Bowl win against Northern Illinois for a 12-2 finish to his senior season.          Manuel led the Seminoles to a 12-win season for just the third time in program history and the first time since their dominant stretch in the 1990s. During his senior season, he threw for the second most yards in team history with 3,392, trailing only Chris Weinke's Heisman Trophy winning season, in which Weinke threw for 4,167 yards. Manuel went 25-6 as a starter, won the first BCS bowl for Florida State since 2000, won five out of six games against intrastate rivals Miami and Florida, and he also led the offense to its most prolific season in team history, cleanly surpassing the 1999 National Championship squad with 6,591 yards.          Career statistics          NFL.com analyst Bucky Brooks projected him as a top five quarterback heading into the 2013 draft and compared him to Josh Freeman. While Manuel possesses the blue-chip physical characteristics, work ethic and leadership qualities necessary to be successful at the NFL level, he has been faulted for somewhat inconsistent play at times during his college career.          Manuel was the 16th overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. Manuel was the only quarterback taken in the first round of the draft, a draft that was seen as especially thin at quarterback (the Bills, who originally drafted eighth and had a great need for a quarterback, even traded down to obtain more picks); Manuel was drafted ahead of higher-profile quarterbacks such as Matt Barkley and Geno Smith, as well as Ryan Nassib, who had played under Bills head coach Doug Marrone when Marrone coached the Syracuse Orange.          On June 14, 2013, Manuel signed a four year contract with the Buffalo Bills. The deal is worth a fully guaranteed $8.88 million, including a signing bonus of $4.85 million evenly spaced out annually ($1.2 million) over the next four years. His salary in 2013 will be $1.6 million, $2.0 million in 2014, $2.4 million in 2015, and $2.8 million in 2016.          Manuel made his professional debut on August 11, 2013, during the preseason against the Indianapolis Colts, completing 16 out of 21 passes for 107 yards and a touchdown. Manuel underwent an operation on his knee to remove fluid buildup after the second game of the preseason and it was unsure if he would be ready to start the 2013 regular season opener. On September 4, 2013, Doug Marrone announced at the team meeting that Manuel was confirmed to be the starter for Week 1. In week 1, Manuel completed his first touchdown to fellow rookie Robert Woods, on an 18 yard completion. On September 16, 2013, Manuel engineered his first fourth quarter comeback, with a nine-play, 80-yard touchdown march to bring his team from a six point deficit in the fourth quarter with seconds left in the game. The Buffalo Bills went on to win the Week 2 bout over the Carolina Panthers 24-23. Manuel was voted the ""Pepsi Next NFL Rookie of the Week"" for his performance.          On October 3, 2013, during the third quarter against the Cleveland Browns, Manuel sprained the lateral collateral ligament in his right knee. The injury caused him to miss the next 5 weeks of his rookie season. Manuel had an up and down first year, but was given a vote of confidence by coach Doug Marrone as he was announced as the starting quarterback for the 2014 season.          On September 28, 2014, in a game against the Houston Texans, one of Manuel's passes was intercepted by J.J. Watt and returned 80 yards for a touchdown. The next day, Manuel was benched in favor of veteran quarterback Kyle Orton after starting the first 4 games of the 2014 season and bringing the Bills a 2-2 record. Orton would win 7 of the next 12 games, finishing the Bills 2014 season 9-7, the first time the team had posted a winning record since 2004.          After posting the franchise's first winning record in a decade, Orton retired and Marrone opted out of the rest of his contract. The Bills then hired former division rival Rex Ryan as head coach. Manuel competed with free agent acquisition Tyrod Taylor and trade acquisition Matt Cassel for the starting quarterback job. During mini-camp, Manuel struggled to compete for the starting job and was listed as the number three quarterback on the depth chart. Manuel performed well in the third preseason game, completing nearly all of his passes, showing he had improved his accuracy. On August 31, 2015 coach Rex Ryan announced that Manuel and Matt Cassel lost the starting job to Tyrod Taylor.          Manuel made his first start in over a year week 6 against the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals in place of injured Tyrod Taylor, who suffered a MCL injury the previous week. On the first drive of the game for the Bills against the Bengals, Manuel led the Bills 80 yards down the field for a touchdown. Manuel finished with a stat line of 28-for-42, 263 passing yards, a passing touchdown, one touchdown rushing, and an interception in the 34-21 loss.          Against the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 in London, Manuel threw for 298 yards and 2 touchdowns but had 3 costly turnovers, two of which were returned directly for scores by the Jacksonville defense in the second quarter. He rallied the Bills from 24 points down to take the lead in the 4th. However, Jacksonville regained the lead with a Blake Bortles touchdown pass to Allen Hurns, sealing the win 34-31 as the Bills were unable to respond. With the loss, Manuel became the first NFL quarterback to lose a game in three different countries (United States, Canada, England).          On May 2, 2016, it was announced that the Buffalo Bills declined to exercise his fifth-year option for the 2017 season.          It was reported that Manuel would be offering stock in his future earnings via a venture with Fantex, Inc. as part of a new financial instrument being sold by Fantex. Manuel planned on offering a 10% share of all future earnings from his brand to Fantex, which would then turn around and divide it into shares of a publicly traded tracking stock.          In July 2014, the Manuel/Fantex stock offering was completed. 523,700 shares were sold, valued at $10 per share.","['1990 births', 'Living people', 'African-American players of American football', 'Sportspeople from Virginia Beach, Virginia', 'Players of American football from Virginia', 'Under Armour All-American football players', 'American football quarterbacks', 'Florida State Seminoles football players', 'Buffalo Bills players']"
2898955,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2898955,Pithoragarh district,"Pithoragarh district () is the easternmost Himalayan district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is naturally landscaped with high Himalayan mountains, snow-capped peaks, passes, valleys, alpine meadows, forests, waterfalls, perennial rivers, glaciers, and springs. The flora and fauna of the area have rich ecological diversity. Pithoragarh has many temples and ruined forts from the once flourishing reign of the warrior Chand Kingdom.          The geographical area of the district is . At the 2011 census, the total population of the district was 485,993. The total literacy rate was 82.93 percent. Pithoragarh town, which is located in Saur Valley (), is its headquarters. The district is within the Kumaon division () of Uttarakhand state. The Tibet plateau is situated to the north and Nepal is to the east. The Kali River originates from Kalapaani and flows south, forming the eastern border with Nepal. The Hindu pilgrimage route for Mount Kailash-Lake Manasarovar passes through this district via Lipulekh Pass in the greater Himalayas. The district is administratively divided into five tehsils: Munsiyari; Dharchula; Didihat; Gangolihat; and Pithoragarh. Naini Saini Airport is the nearest civil airport, but it does not have regular scheduled commercial passenger service. The mineral deposits present in the district are magnesium ore, copper ore, limestone, and slate.          Some attribute the name to King Pithora Chand from the Chand Dynasty, while others cite Prithvi Raj Chauhan of the Chauhan Rajputs, who built a fort named Pithora Garh in the Saur Valley.          After its conquest by Bhartpal, the Rajwar of Uku (now in Nepal), in the year 1364, Pithoragarh was ruled for the rest of the 14th century by three generations of Pals, and the kingdom extended from Pithoragarh to Askot.          According to a ""tamrapatra"" (inscribed copper or brass plaque) from 1420, the Pal dynasty, based out of Askot, was uprooted by Chand kings. Vijay Brahm (of the Brahm dynasty from Doti) took over the empire as King. Following the death of Gyan Chand, in a conflict with Kshetra Pal, the Pals were able to regain the throne.          It is believed that Bharti Chand, an ancestor of Gyan Chand, had replaced Bams, the ruler of Pithoragarh, after defeating them in 1445. In the 16th century, the Chand dynasty again took control over Pithoragarh town and, in 1790, built a new fort on the hill where the present Girls Inter College is situated. This fort was destroyed by the Indian government in 1962 after China attacked India.          The Chand rule, at its zenith, is seen as one of the most prominent empires in Kumaon.

On 8 March 2013, the Beechcraft 1900C-1 serving the flight, registration N116AX, crashed into a mountain on approach to Dillingham Municipal Airport, killing both crew members operating the flight.          The aircraft, a Beechcraft 1900C-1, serial number UC-17 registered N116AX, was manufactured in 1992, and ACE Air Cargo was its only operator, accumulating a total of 29,824 hours before the accident. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65B engines and was equipped for flight into icy conditions, but did not carry a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder.          The crew on this flight consisted of only the cockpit crew, 38-year-old Captain Jeff Day and 21-year-old First Officer Neil Jensen with 5,770 flight hours and 470 flight hours, respectively.          The flight had originally taken off from Anchorage International Airport at approximately 5:44 Alaska Standard Time, making a scheduled stop at King Salmon and continuing to Dillingham. En-route to Dillingham, the crew requested a RNAV GPS 19 instrument approach, which was granted by the on-duty controller who directed the crew to maintain an altitude at or above . Roughly six minutes later, the crew requested permission to enter into a holding pattern to contact the flight service station for a report on the condition of the runway, which was subsequently granted. The controllers later attempted to contact the aircraft, but were unsuccessful and soon lost radar track of the aircraft, which had crashed at Muklung Hills.          The aircraft hit the ground in a mountainous area called the Muklung Hills. This was the same area where, in 2010, an aircraft carrying nine people crashed; the passengers included former US Senator Ted Stevens, who was one of the five killed, and former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe, who was one of the four survivors. The rescue operation to reach Flight 51 was carried out by the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska State Troopers, and United States Coast Guard. The first rescue unit to reach the crash site was an Alaska Air National Guard helicopter, which was unable to land or lower rescuers due to poor weather conditions.          The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) who concluded that the plane crashed due to pilot error.","['2013 in Alaska', 'Airliner accidents and incidents in Alaska', 'Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 2013', 'Dillingham Census Area, Alaska']"

In the case of Sindh, there were three direct instances of governor's rule under Mian Aminuddin, Rahimuddin Khan and Moinuddin Haider respectively, in 1951-1953, 1988, and 1998 when the provincial chief ministers of those times were removed and assemblies dissolved.

Greer was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and played with Elmer Snowden's band and the Howard Theatre's orchestra in Washington, D.C. before joining Duke Ellington, whom he met in 1919. He was Ellington's first drummer, playing with his quintet, the Washingtonians, and moving with Ellington into the Cotton Club. As a result of his job as a designer with the Leedy Drum Company of Indiana, Greer was able to build up a huge drum kit worth over a then-considerable $3,000, including chimes, a gong, timpani, and vibes.          Greer was a heavy drinker, as well as a pool-hall hustler (when he needed to retrieve his drums from the pawnbroker), and in 1950 Ellington responded to his drinking and occasional unreliability by taking a second drummer, Butch Ballard, with them on a tour of Scandinavia. This enraged Greer, and the consequent argument led to their permanent estrangement.          Greer continued to play, mainly as a freelance drummer, working with musicians such as Johnny Hodges, Red Allen, J. C. Higginbotham, Tyree Glenn, and Brooks Kerr, as well as appearing in films, and briefly leading his own band.

25090575,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25090575,Taenia taeniaeformis,"Taenia taeniaeformis is a parasitic tapeworm, with cats as the primary definitive hosts. Sometime dogs can also be the definitive host. The intermediate hosts of this tapeworm are primarily rodents and less frequently lagomorphs (rabbits) which the cat must kill and ingest their liver in order to acquire the tapeworm infection. The worm tends to be white, thick bodied, and around 15 to 60 cm in length. This species of tape worm is much less frequently encountered than ""Dipylidium caninum"", which has fleas as its intermediate host rather than rodents but exhibits most of the same physical characteristics and is treated with the same medications (i.e., antihelminthics).          The definitive host must ingest the strobilocercus stage of the tapeworm in order to acquire the parasite. The strobilocercus is a larval stage that has a terminal bladder and a rather long segmented body that is in crowned with the scolex that looks very similar to that found on the adult form. It seems that the strobilocercus must attain an age of about 2 months before it is in infective to a cat upon ingestion. Once a cat ingests the strobilocercus, the posterior portion of the larva is in digested away and then the anterior portion begins to develop. Infection in the cat will develop and become obvious between 30 and 80 days after the cat has ingested the infected liver of a prey animal. Once the infection is established, it can last for between seven months and three years. A cat will produce between three and four motile segments per day either excreted in the feces or through direct migration, each containing between 500 and 12,000 eggs. Spontaneous worm destrobilization (the shedding of the entire portion of the body located behind the scolex and containing all of the strobila) may occur without any change in actual infection. Once shed, the proglotids are often very active and are capable of crawling considerable distances as they shed their eggs. Actual eggs are spheroid and are between 31 and 36 micrometers in diameter. Superinfection in cats is possible if they are fed young tapeworms in the presence of established mature ones.          Infection in cats is in diagnosed by finding the distinctive segments in the feces or by finding the eggs upon fecal flotation. You may also see small segments lying around where the animal has been that have exited through the anus. To identify a segment, it can be crushed on a glass slide and examined for eggs.          Praziquantel (5 mg/kg body weight) and epsiprantel have both been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of taeniataeniaeformis in cats. Similarly, febantel and fenbendazole are approved for the treatment of this parasite in most of the world. Mebendazole and nitroscanate are also products that have efficacy against taeniataeniaeformis in cats.",['Cestoda']
299592,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299592,Optical disc drive,"In computing, an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, CD writer drive, and combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drive. As of 2015, DVD writer drive is the most common for desktop PCs and laptops. There are also the DVD-ROM drive, BD-ROM drive, Blu-ray Disc combo (BD-ROM/DVD±RW/CD-RW) drive, and Blu-ray Disc writer drive.          Optical disc drives are an integral part of standalone appliances such as CD players, VCD players, DVD players, Blu-ray disc players, DVD recorders, certain desktop video game consoles, such as Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, Nintendo Wii U, and Sony PlayStation 3, and certain portable video game consoles, such as Sony PlayStation Portable. They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and consumer media distributed on disc, and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. Floppy disk drives, with capacity of 1.44 MB, have been made obsolete: optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy discs, and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. USB flash drives, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive, are suitable where read/write capability is required.          Disc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances (films, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data (e.g., a standard DVD holds 4.7 gigabytes) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small scale; mass-producing large numbers of identical discs is cheaper and faster than individual recording.          Optical discs are used to back up relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, which typically contain many hundreds of gigabytes or even multiple terabytes, is less practical. Large backups are often instead made on external hard drives, as their price has dropped to a level making this viable; in professional environments magnetic tape drives are also used.          The first laser disc, demonstrated in 1972, was the ""Laservision"" 12-inch video disc. The video signal was stored as an analog format like a video cassette. The first digitally recorded optical disc was a 5-inch audio compact disc (CD) in a read-only format created by Philips and Sony in 1975. Five years later, the same two companies introduced a digital storage solution for computers using this same CD size called a CD-ROM. Not until 1987 did Sony demonstrate the erasable and rewritable 5.25-inch optical drive.          The most important part of an optical disc drive is an ""optical path"", placed in a ""pickup head"" (""PUH""), usually consisting of semiconductor laser, a lens for guiding the laser beam, and photodiodes detecting the light reflection from disc's surface.          Initially, CD lasers with a wavelength of 780 nm were used, being within infrared range. For DVDs, the wavelength was reduced to 650 nm (red color), and the wavelength for Blu-ray Disc was reduced to 405 nm (violet color).          Two main servomechanisms are used, the first one to maintain a correct distance between lens and disc, and ensure the laser beam is focused on a small ""laser spot"" on the disc. The second servo moves a head along the disc's radius, keeping the beam on a ""groove"", a continuous spiral data path.          On ""read only media"" (ROM), during the manufacturing process the groove, made of ""pits"", is pressed on a flat surface, called ""land"". Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the laser's wavelength, the reflected beam's phase is shifted in relation to the incoming reading beam, causing mutual destructive interference and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This is detected by photodiodes that output electrical signals.          A recorder encodes (or ""burns"") data onto a recordable CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, or BD-R disc (called a ""blank"") by selectively heating parts of an organic dye layer with a laser. This changes the reflectivity of the dye, thereby creating marks that can be read like the pits and lands on pressed discs. For recordable discs, the process is permanent and the media can be written to only once. While the reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 mW, the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The higher the writing speed, the less time a laser has to heat a point on the media, thus its power has to increase proportionally. DVD burners' lasers often peak at about 200 mW, either in continuous wave and pulses, although some have been driven up to 400 mW before the diode fails.          For rewritable CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, or BD-RE media, the laser is used to melt a crystalline metal alloy in the recording layer of the disc. Depending on the amount of power applied, the substance may be allowed to melt back (change the phase back) into crystalline form or left in an amorphous form, enabling marks of varying reflectivity to be created.          ""Double-sided"" media may be used, but they are not easily accessed with a standard drive, as they must be physically turned over to access the data on the other side.          ""Double layer"" (DL) media have two independent data layers separated by a semi-reflective layer. Both layers are accessible from the same side, but require the optics to change the laser's focus. Traditional ""single layer"" (SL) writable media are produced with a spiral groove molded in the protective polycarbonate layer (not in the data recording layer), to lead and synchronize the speed of recording head. Double-layered writable media have: a first polycarbonate layer with a (shallow) groove, a first data layer, a semi-reflective layer, a second (spacer) polycarbonate layer with another (deep) groove, and a second data layer. The first groove spiral usually starts on the inner edge and extends outwards, while the second groove starts on the outer edge and extends inwards.          Some drives support Hewlett-Packard's LightScribe photothermal printing technology for labeling specially coated discs.          The rotational mechanism in an optical drive differs considerably from that of a hard disk drive's, in that the latter keeps a constant angular velocity (CAV), in other words a constant number of revolutions per minute (RPM). With CAV, a higher throughput is generally achievable at the outer disc compared to the inner.          On the other hand, optical drives were developed with an assumption of achieving a constant throughput, in CD drives initially equal to 150 KiB/s. It was a feature important for streaming audio data that always tend to require a constant bit rate. But to ensure no disc capacity was wasted, a head had to transfer data at a maximum linear rate at all times too, without slowing on the outer rim of disc. This led to optical drives—until recently—operating with a constant linear velocity (CLV). The spiral ""groove"" of the disc passed under its head at a constant speed. The implication of CLV, as opposed to CAV, is that disc angular velocity is no longer constant, and the spindle motor needed to be designed to vary its speed from between 200 RPM on the outer rim and 500 RPM on the inner.          Later CD drives kept the CLV paradigm, but evolved to achieve higher rotational speeds, popularly described in multiples of a base speed. As a result, a 4× drive, for instance, would rotate at 800-2000 RPM, while transferring data steadily at 600 KiB/s, which is equal to 4 × 150 KiB/s.          For DVDs, base or 1× speed is 1.385 MB/s, equal to 1.32 MiB/s, approximately 9 times faster than the CD base speed. For Blu-ray drives, base speed is 6.74 MB/s, equal to 6.43 MiB/s.           Because keeping a constant transfer rate for the whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the zoned constant linear velocity (Z-CLV) scheme. This divides the disc into several zones, each having its own constant linear velocity. A Z-CLV recorder rated at ""52×"", for example, would write at 20× on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52× at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove, but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.          Both DVDs and CDs have been known to explode when damaged and/or spun at excessive speed. This imposes a constraint on the maximum speed (56× for CDs or around 18× in the case of DVDs) at which drives can operate.          Current optical drives use either a ""tray-loading"" mechanism, where the disc is loaded onto a motorized or manually operated tray, or a ""slot-loading"" mechanism, where the disc is slid into a slot and drawn in by motorized rollers. With both types of mechanism, if a CD or DVD is left in the drive after the computer is turned off, the disc cannot be ejected using the normal eject mechanism of the drive. However, tray-loading drives account for this situation by providing a small hole where one can insert a straightened paperclip to manually open the drive tray to retrieve the disc. Slot-loading optical disc drives have the disadvantages that they cannot usually accept the smaller 80 mm discs (unless 80 mm optical disc adapter is used) or any non-standard sizes, usually have no emergency eject hole or eject button, and therefore have to be disassembled if the optical disc cannot be ejected normally. However, the Nintendo Wii, because of backwards compatibility with Nintendo GameCube games, and PlayStation 3 video game consoles are able to load standard size DVDs and 80 mm discs in the same slot-loading drive.          A small number of drive models, mostly compact portable units, have a ""top-loading"" mechanism where the drive lid is opened upwards and the disc is placed directly onto the spindle (for example, all PlayStation One consoles, portable CD players, and some standalone CD recorders all feature top-loading drives). These sometimes have the advantage of using spring-loaded ball bearings to hold the disc in place, minimizing damage to the disc if the drive is moved while it is spun up.          Some early CD-ROM drives used a mechanism where CDs had to be inserted into special cartridges or caddies, somewhat similar in appearance to a 3.5"" floppy diskette. This was intended to protect the disc from accidental damage by enclosing it in a tougher plastic casing, but did not gain wide acceptance due to the additional cost and compatibility concerns—such drives would also inconveniently require ""bare"" discs to be manually inserted into an openable caddy before use. Ultra Density Optical and Universal Media Disc use optical disc cartridges.          There were also some early CD-ROM drives for desktop PCs in which its tray-loading mechanism will eject slightly and user has to pull out the tray manually to load CD, similar to the tray ejecting method used in internal optical disc drives of modern laptops and modern external slim portable optical disc drives. Like the top-loading mechanism, they have spring-loaded ball bearings on the spindle.          Most internal drives for personal computers, servers and workstations are designed to fit in a standard 5.25"" drive bay and connect to their host via an ATA or SATA interface. Additionally, there may be digital and analog outputs for audio. The outputs may be connected via a header cable to the sound card or the motherboard. At one time, computer software resembling cd players controlled playback of the CD. Today the information is extracted from the disc as data, to be played back or converted to other file formats.          External drives usually have USB or FireWire interfaces. Some portable versions for laptops power themselves from batteries or directly from their interface bus.          Drives with SCSI interface were made, but they are less common and tend to be more expensive, because of the cost of their interface chipsets, more complex SCSI connectors, and small volume of sales.          When the optical disc drive was first developed, it was not easy to add to computer systems. Some computers such as the IBM PS/2 were standardizing on the 3.5"" floppy and 3.5"" hard disk, and did not include a place for a large internal device. Also IBM PCs and clones at first only included a single (parallel) ATA drive interface, which by the time the CDROM was introduced, was already being used to support two hard drives. Early laptops simply had no built-in high-speed interface for supporting an external storage device.          This was solved through several techniques:          The optical drives in the photos are shown right side up; the disc would sit on top of them. The laser and optical system scans the underside of the disc.          With reference to the top photo, just to the right of image center is the disc motor, a metal cylinder, with a gray centering hub and black rubber drive ring on top. There is a disc-shaped round clamp, loosely held inside the cover and free to rotate; it's not in the photo. After the disc tray stops moving inward, as the motor and its attached parts rise, a magnet near the top of the rotating assembly contacts and strongly attracts the clamp to hold and center the disc. This motor is an ""outrunner""-style brushless DC motor which has an external rotor – every visible part of it spins.          Two parallel guide rods that run between upper left and lower right in the photo carry the ""sled"", the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this ""sled"" is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes at the edge of the disc. To move the ""sled"" during continuous read or write operations, a stepper motor rotates a leadscrew to move the ""sled"" throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods. The leadscrew is the rod with evenly-spaced darker details; these are the helical grooves that engage a pin on the ""sled"".          In contrast, the mechanism shown in the second photo, which comes from a cheaply made DVD player, uses less accurate and less efficient brushed DC motors to both move the sled and spin the disc. Some older drives use a DC motor to move the sled, but also have a magnetic rotary encoder to keep track of the position. Most drives in computers use stepper motors.          The gray metal chassis is shock-mounted at its four corners to reduce sensitivity to external shocks, and to reduce drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft shock mount grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).          In the third photo, the components under the cover of the lens mechanism are visible. The two permanent magnets on either side of the lens holder as well as the coils that move the lens can be seen. This allows the lens to be moved up, down, forwards, and backwards to stabilize the focus of the beam.          In the fourth photo, the inside of the optics package can be seen. Note that since this is a CD-ROM drive, there is only one laser, which is the black component mounted to the bottom left of the assembly. Just above the laser are the first focusing lens and prism that direct the beam at the disc. The tall, thin object in the center is a half-silvered mirror that splits the laser beam in multiple directions. To the bottom right of the mirror is the main photodiode that senses the beam reflected off the disc. Above the main photodiode is a second photodiode that is used to sense and regulate the power of the laser.          The irregular orange material is flexible etched copper foil supported by thin sheet plastic; these are ""flexible printed circuits"" that connect everything to the electronics (which is not shown).          Most optical drives are backwards compatible with their ancestors up to CD, although this is not required by standards.          Compared to a CD's 1.2 mm layer of polycarbonate, a DVD's laser beam only has to penetrate 0.6 mm in order to reach the recording surface. This allows a DVD drive to focus the beam on a smaller spot size and to read smaller pits. DVD lens supports a different focus for CD or DVD media with same laser. With the newer Blu-ray disc drives, the laser only has to penetrate 0.1 mm of material. Thus the optical assembly would normally have to have an even greater focus range. In practice, the Blu-ray optical system is separate from the DVD/CD system.          During the times of CD writer drives, they are often marked with three different speed ratings. In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40×/16×/48× CD writer drive is capable of writing to CD-R media at speed of 40× (6,000 KB/s), writing to CD-RW media at speed of 16× (2,400 KB/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media at speed of 48× (7,200 KB/s).          During the times of combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drives, an additional speed rating (e.g., the 16× in 52×/32×/52×/16×) is designated for DVD-ROM media reading operations.          For DVD writer drives, Blu-ray disc combo drives, and Blu-ray disc writer drives, the writing and reading speed of their respective optical media are specified in its retail box, user's manual, and/or bundled brochures or pamphlets.          In the late 1990s, ""buffer underruns"" became a very common problem as high-speed CD recorders began to appear in home and office computers, which—for a variety of reasons—often could not muster the I/O performance to keep the data stream to the recorder steadily fed. The recorder, should it run short, would be forced to halt the recording process, leaving a truncated track that usually renders the disc useless.          In response, manufacturers of CD recorders began shipping drives with ""buffer underrun protection"" (under various trade names, such as Sanyo's ""BURN-Proof"", Ricoh's ""JustLink"" and Yamaha's ""Lossless Link""). These can suspend and resume the recording process in such a way that the gap the stoppage produces can be dealt with by the error-correcting logic built into CD players and CD-ROM drives. The first of these drives were rated at 12× and 16×.          While drives are burning DVD+R, DVD+RW and all Blu-ray formats, they do not require any such error correcting recovery as the recorder is able to place the new data exactly on the end of the suspended write effectively producing a continuous track (this is what the DVD+ technology achieved). Although later interfaces were able to stream data at the required speed, many drives now write in a 'zoned constant linear velocity'. This means that the drive has to temporarily suspend the write operation while it changes speed and then recommence it once the new speed is attained. This is handled in the same manner as a buffer underrun.          The internal buffer of optical disc writer drives is: 8 MiB when recording BD-R/BD-R DL/BD-RE/BD-RE DL media; 2 MiB when recording DVD-R/DVD-RW/DVD-R DL/DVD+R/DVD+RW/DVD+RW DL/DVD-RAM/CD-R/CD-RW media.          CD recording on personal computers was originally a batch-oriented task in that it required specialised authoring software to create an ""image"" of the data to record, and to record it to disc in the one session. This was acceptable for archival purposes, but limited the general convenience of CD-R and CD-RW discs as a removable storage medium.          Packet writing is a scheme in which the recorder writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential packet writing fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, the disc can be ""closed"" at any time by writing a final table-of-contents to the start of the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. Packet writing, together with support from the operating system and a file system like UDF, can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.          Fixed-length packet writing (on CD-RW and DVD-RW media) divides up the disc into padded, fixed-size packets. The padding reduces the capacity of the disc, but allows the recorder to start and stop recording on an individual packet without affecting its neighbours. These resemble the block-writable access offered by magnetic media closely enough that many conventional file systems will work as-is. Such discs, however, are not readable in most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives or on most operating systems without additional third-party drivers. The division into packets is not as reliable as it may seem as CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W) drives can only locate data to within a data block. Although generous gaps (the padding referred to above) are left between blocks, the drive nevertheless can occasionally miss and either destroy some existing data or even render the disc unreadable.          The DVD+RW disc format eliminates this unreliability by embedding more accurate timing hints in the data groove of the disc and allowing individual data blocks (or even bytes) to be replaced without affecting backwards compatibility (a feature dubbed ""lossless linking""). The format itself was designed to deal with discontinuous recording because it was expected to be widely used in digital video recorders. Many such DVRs use variable-rate video compression schemes which require them to record in short bursts; some allow simultaneous playback and recording by alternating quickly between recording to the tail of the disc whilst reading from elsewhere. The Blu-ray disc system also encompasses this technology.          Mount Rainier aims to make packet-written CD-RW and DVD+RW discs as convenient to use as that of removable magnetic media by having the firmware format new discs in the background and manage media defects (by automatically mapping parts of the disc which have been worn out by erase cycles to reserve space elsewhere on the disc). As of February 2007, support for Mount Rainier is natively supported in Windows Vista. All previous versions of Windows require a third-party solution, as does Mac OS X.          Owing to pressure from the music industry, as represented by the IFPI and RIAA, Philips developed the ""Recorder Identification Code"" (RID) to allow media to be uniquely associated with the recorder that has written it. This standard is contained in the Rainbow Books. The RID-Code consists of a supplier code (e.g. ""PHI"" for Philips), a model number and the unique ID of the recorder. Quoting Philips, the RID ""enables a trace for each disc back to the exact machine on which it was made using coded information in the recording itself. The use of the RID code is mandatory.""          Although the RID was introduced for music and video industry purposes, the RID is included on every disc written by every drive, including data and backup discs. The value of the RID is questionable as it is (currently) impossible to locate any individual recorder due to there being no database.          The Source IDentification Code (SID) is an eight character supplier code that is placed on optical discs by the manufacturer. The SID identifies not only manufacturer, but also the individual factory and machine that produced the disc.          According to Phillips, the administrator of the SID codes, the SID code provides an optical disc production facility with the means to identify all discs mastered and/or replicated in its plant, including the specific Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or disc.          The standard use of RID and SID mean that each disc written contains a record of the machine that produced a disc (the SID), and which drive wrote it (the RID). This combined knowledge may be very useful to law enforcement, to investigative agencies, and to private and/or corporate investigators.","['American inventions', 'Audio storage', 'Optical computer storage', 'Optoelectronics', 'Video storage']"

14852221,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14852221,Isolationist (comics),"The Isolationist (Josef Huber) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Peter David and Pablo Raimondi. The character's first appearance was in ""X-Factor"" vol. 1, #89 on a single page, but his story wasn't continued until ""X-Factor"" vol. 3 #16, fifteen years later.          Isolationist is a German telepath who convinced Jamie Madrox, Beast, and Cyclops to organize a ""Million Mutant March"" political rally to get mutants declared an endangered species by the United States government. However, Layla Miller told Madrox that one of Huber's agents had tried to kill her, and it was revealed that Huber's plan was a plot to get all the mutants in one place so they could be destroyed. Huber claimed that all the mutant voices in his head were driving him crazy and that had manipulated and arranged all of X-Factor Investigations' problems and adventures. Then he teleported the team to a frozen wasteland.          He also somehow arranged for a young French girl named Nicole (actually an android created by Huber) to be taken in by M and Siryn in Paris, seemingly of their own free will, despite later stating that M and Siryn are immune to his telepathic suggestions.          When Layla Miller survived a murder attempt by Nicole (thanks to a mentally unstable Quicksilver's intervention), Huber's plans came undone. Layla warned Madrox about Huber, who then fought Madrox, Strong Guy, and Wolfsbane. Huber teleported the three to the Antarctic. They were then out of communication range of M and Siryn, who were busy on a case, which had also been arranged by Huber, with the aid of a family of mutant haters. M became worried and flew back to X-Factor headquarters, arriving just in time to stop Huber from smashing Rictor with a car. Rictor had been more or less successfully fighting Huber; Rictor was immune to the direct applications of Huber's mutant powers because Rictor was using Terrigen crystals he had left over from his time with Quicksilver. Huber had not foreseen this. Huber turned to sand and floated away, disdaining tedious fighting in favor of his planned genocide. He returned to his icy cave.          The Isolationist possesses the abilities of all living mutants on the planet or approximately two-hundred different mutant power sets. This would place him among the most powerful beings in the Marvel universe, although it is unclear how much he is hindered by his telepathy.          He has displayed the use of eye beams, ice beams, teleportation, steel skin and superhuman strength, and telepathy.           His abilities weaken the further he is away from mutants, though his ability of telepathy remains strong enough to disturb him even when he is in isolation. He has a weakness and inability to control his telepathy, and constantly hears the thoughts of people around the world.           Using a power he copied from Forge's technological-knack mutation, the Isolationist has created advanced devices including a teleporter and a lifelike robot.          He is unable to shut off his overwhelming mind-reading powers, even with his isolation and the use of pills, thus causing him constant misery as he reads the minds of people simultaneously throughout the world, forcing him to ingest large amounts of painkillers and depressants to dull his senses. The addition of a telepath close to his proximity is particularly disturbing to him.          His powers also create a mental block that prevents him from directly using his powers against mutants; as a result, while he can put them in situations that ""might"" kill them- such as when he created a portal to send X-Factor to the arctic regions where they would ""eventually"" freeze to death - he cannot simply destroy a mutant's mind with his telepathy or tear them apart with his physical strength.","['Comics characters introduced in 1993', 'Characters created by Peter David', 'Fictional inventors', 'Marvel Comics characters who can teleport', 'Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength', 'Marvel Comics supervillains', 'Marvel Comics telepaths']"
1805298,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805298,Bugatti Type 35,"The Type 35 was the most successful of the Bugatti racing models. Its version of the Bugatti arch-shaped radiator that had evolved from the more architectural one of the Bugatti Type 13 Brescia, was to become the one that the marque is most known for though even in the ranks of the various Type 35s there were variations on the theme.          The Type 35 was phenomenally successful, winning over 1,000 races in its time. It took the Grand Prix World Championship in 1926 after winning 351 races and setting 47 records in the two prior years. At its height, Type 35s averaged 14 race wins per week. Bugatti won the Targa Florio for five consecutive years, from 1925 through 1929, with the Type 35.          The original model, introduced at the Grand Prix of Lyon on August 3, 1924, used an evolution of the 3-valve 2.0 L (1991 cc/121 in³) overhead cam straight-8 engine first seen on the Type 29. Bore was 60 mm and stroke was 88 mm as on many previous Bugatti models. Ninety-six examples were produced.          This new powerplant featured five main bearings with an unusual ball bearing system. This allowed the engine to rev to 6000 rpm, and 90 hp (67 kW) was reliably produced. Solid axles with leaf springs were used front and rear, and drum brakes at the back, operated by cables, were specified. Alloy wheels were a novelty, as was the hollow front axle for reduced unsprung weight. A second feature of the Type 35 that was to become a Bugatti trademark was passing the springs through the front axle rather than simply U-bolting them together as was done on their earlier cars.          A rare version was de-bored (to 52 mm) for a total displacement of 1.5 L (1494 cc/91 in³). There are two of these rare cars in New Zealand.          Dimensions:          A less expensive version of the Type 35 appeared in May, 1925. The factory's ""Type 35A"" name was ignored by the public, who nicknamed it ""Tecla"" after a famous maker of imitation jewelry. The Tecla's engine used three plain bearings, smaller valves, and coil ignition like the Type 30. While this decreased maintenance requirements, it also reduced output. One-hundred thirty nine of the Type 35As were sold.          The Type 35C featured a Roots supercharger, despite Ettore Bugatti's disdain for forced induction. Output was nearly 128 hp (95 kW) with a single Zenith carburettor. Type 35Cs won the French Grand Prix at Saint-Gaudens in 1928, and at Pau in 1930. Fifty examples left the factory.          For 1926, Bugatti introduced a special model for the Targa Florio race. Called the ""Type 35T"" officially, it soon became known as the ""Targa Florio"". Engine displacement was up to 2.3 L (2262 cc/138 in³) with a longer 100 mm stroke. Grand Prix rule changes limiting capacity to 2.0 L limited the appeal of this model at the time with just thirteen produced.          The final version of the Type 35 series was the Type 35B of 1927. Originally named ""Type 35TC"", it shared the 2.3 L engine of the Type 35T but added a large supercharger like the Type 35C. Output was 138 hp (102 kW), and 45 examples were made. A British racing green Type 35B driven by William Grover-Williams won the 1929 French Grand Prix at Le Mans.          The Type 35 chassis and body were reused on the Type 37 sports car. Fitted with a new 1.5 L (1496 cc/91 in³) straight-4 engine, 290 Type 37s were built. This engine was an SOHC three-valve design and produced 60 hp (44 kW). The same engine went on to be used in the Type 40.          The supercharged Type 37A accounted for 67 of the Type 37's production slots. Engine output was up to . It also had larger shrouded brake drums.          The Type 39 was basically identical to the Type 35C except for its engine. This was modified to be smaller at 1.5 L (1493 cc/91 in³) with a shorter-stroked crankshaft. This brought stroke down from 88 mm to 66 mm, and a mix of regular and ball bearings were used. Ten examples were produced.          An odd 1.1 L (1092 cc/66 in³) version was also created by reducing the bore of the engine to 51.3 mm.","['Bugatti automobiles', 'Grand Prix cars', '24 Hours of Le Mans race cars']"
41155972,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41155972,Ramón Saldívar,"Ramón Saldívar (born 1949) is a Mexican-American author, teacher and researcher of cultural studies and Chicano literature. He is currently a professor at Stanford University, and received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama in 2012.          Saldívar grew up in Brownsville, Texas, a town on the Mexico-United States border. Saldívar said in an interview that “From downtown Brownsville, you can literally look across the river and, a hundred yards away or so, there’s Mexico. To me, growing up, that was always normal life, that was the way the world worked: bilingual, binational, transcultural in all sorts of ways.” He was raised in a Spanish speaking household, learning English only after entering school.          He graduated from Brownsville High School in 1968, and pursued undergraduate studies at the University of Texas, Austin. Saldívar briefly considered a career in law or a return to Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, but ultimately earned a degree in comparative literature and graduated with highest honors, and a membership in the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He went on to earn a Master of Philosophy from Yale University in 1975 and a Ph.D two years later.          After graduating from Yale, Saldívar spent 15 years teaching at UT Austin before accepting a position at Stanford in 1991. He has been a professor of English and Comparative Literature there for the past 22 years. Saldívar acted as Stanford’s Associate Dean and Vice-Provost for Undergraduate Studies from 1994 to 1999, and worked as a Milligan Family University Fellow in Undergraduate Education from 2002 to 2012. He is currently the director of Stanford’s Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. Saldívar’s lectures cover topics in literary criticism and theory, the history of the novel, 19th and 20th-century literature, cultural studies, globalization and transnationalism, and Chicano/a studies.          In February 2012, Saldívar was one of nine scholars honored with a National Humanities Medal by United States President Barack Obama. After receiving the medal, Saldívar said he was both ""completely blown away and deeply moved by the honor.""          Saldívar has written three books, the first of which, ""Figural Language in the Novel: The Flowers of Speech from Cervantes to Joyce"", was published in 1984. In ""Figural Language in the Novel"", Saldívar states that a narrator’s primary duty is to employ a grammar and syntax for communicating both surreal and realistic experiences.          Saldívar’s second book, ""Chicano Narrative: The Dialectics of Difference"", was released in 1990 and focused on the struggle of Mexican-American authors to maintain cultural identity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, a struggle which the author felt had been neglected in the study of American literature.          His most recent book, ""The Borderlands of Culture: Américo Paredes and the Transnational Imaginary"", focuses on Mexican-American scholar Américo Paredes and his contributions to the discourse of cultural studies in the U.S. Saldívar details a history of Paredes’ career in writing about the American southwestern borderlands, and presents Paredes as being among the founders of a new kind of cultural studies in America concerned with the Mexico-United States border and its social and historical significance. The book was published by Duke University Press in 2006, seven years after Paredes died.          Saldívar points out that unlike most ethnic immigrants in the United States, Mexican Americans became an ethnic minority through the direct conquest of their homelands. This change in legal status resulted in the slow development of a unique culture that was distinct from both Mexican and mainstream American Culture.          A focus of Saldívar’s work is the idea that Chicano literature has been relegated to ethnic studies more than it deserves. Saldívar believes that it should instead be considered American literature. “Works by Mexican-American authors are absent from the American literary histories, the anthologies of American literature, and from the syllabi of courses on American literature. Spanish departments in American universities have also participated in this strategy of exclusion,” he says. “This exclusion is by no means innocent.”          Much of that theory, presented in his book ""Chicano Narrative,"" has been met with support from other academics. Maria A. Beltran states in Vocal and American Literature that “Saldívar provides the reader with a more modern, challenging, and sophisticated critical view of Mexican-American literature.” “His aim is to educate Hispanic and non-Hispanic educators and scholars. His book may shock those who still deny that Chicano literature must be included in the teaching of Hispanic and American literature in U.S. colleges and universities, for he strives to demonstrate that, through their works, Chicano authors represent and are part of an American reality that can no longer be ignored.” Hector A. Torres of College Literature called Chicano Narrative “a monumental work on the scene of Chicano/a literary criticism.""          José E. Limón, in American Literary History, criticized Saldívar’s philosophy of Chicano/American integration and the existence of a defined dialectic, that Saldívar described in ""The Borderlands of Culture"" “Saldívar seems too determined to create such a substantial East–West, truly transnational Duboisian figure in Paredes when the available evidence would seem rather to suggest a Mexican-American intellectual of high achievement in two relatively discrete spheres,” he writes.          Saldívar has seven siblings, two of which have also gone on to become professors of literature. His brother, José, teaches at Stanford and his sister Sonia Saldívar-Hull teaches at the University of Texas San Antonio. Saldívar has said that Walt Whitman is his favorite poet, and believes that the contradictions and multitudes he presents in his poetry are similar to the themes used in Chicano literature. Saldívar grew up a self-proclaimed fan of Davy Crockett, but was conflicted when he found out that his hero fought against Mexican forces.","['1949 births', 'American academics', 'Living people', 'American people of Mexican descent', 'Stanford University faculty', 'University of Texas at Austin alumni', 'Yale University alumni', 'American male writers', 'National Humanities Medal recipients']"

Valentino is one of several women who have made public sexual-abuse allegations against Cosby Valentino was one of the five women interviewed in a ""Washington Post"" piece published on November 22, 2014, making her the sixteenth woman to come forward and speak out against Cosby. Valentino met Cosby shortly after the death of her son and claims that the comedian was trying to ""cheer"" her up over her loss. She was accompanied by her former roommate at the time, Meg Foster, and Cosby took the ladies to an apartment after dinner. According to Valentino, Cosby took advantage of her and Foster by drugging them with pills. From her recollection, Valentino noticed that Foster had passed out from the pills and that Cosby stood over Foster with an erection and a ""predatory"" look. ""It was very clear to me that he was going to assault her while she was asleep or unconscious,"" Valentino alleged. ""I reached out, grabbing him, trying to get his attention, trying to distract him. He came over to me and sat down on the love seat and opened his fly and grabbed my head and pushed my head down. And then he turned me over. It was like a waking nightmare."" Valentino states that she has difficulties speaking about her sexual encounter with Bill Cosby, moreover, she did not come forward at the time because she felt that she had ""little credibility.""

She is a three-time Olympian (2000, 2004, and 2008), and a daughter of Valentin Partõka, who competed in both 200 and 400 m individual medley at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, representing the Soviet Union.          Partoka made her first Estonian team, as a 17-year-old swimming teen at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. There, she failed to reach the semifinals in any of her individual events, finishing twenty-ninth in the 100 m freestyle (57.71), and thirty-first in the 200 m freestyle (2:05.90).          At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Partoka competed only in the 200 m freestyle. Swimming in heat three, she edged out New Zealand's Alison Fitch to earn a fourth spot and twenty-eighth overall by four hundredths of a second (0.04) in 2:03.54.

The game was designed for solitairy play (in fact it is one of the very first purpose-designed solitaire games released in box form), but there are rules for a two-player game. Game (mission) length can vary from 5 to 20 minutes depending on the target.          Several variants exist including a 15th Air Force theater variant along with aircraft variants that include the late-model Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress, the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Royal Air Force Avro Lancaster and late-war Luftwaffe aircraft (including the Messerschmitt Me 262 and Messerschmitt Me 163 jet aircraft). This game is also adaptable to a more role-playing game style of play. These variants were released in periodicals such as The General Magazine.          Bombers and crews in this simulation suffer from high casualty rates. Only when long-range fighter escorts (specifically the North American P-51 Mustang) were deployed did the attrition rate for crew diminish. Until the deployment of long-range escorts, the bombers had to fight their way to the target and back (as in this simulation).          The game is dice-driven, and relies on charts and tables to determine outcomes. Player participation is minimal, as the game system picks the targets to be flown to, and the enemy opposition as well as a number of random events that might take place (representing damage or failure of equipment on the plane, navigational errors, etc.). Player participation is limited to allocating defensive fire from the multiple weapons positions on the bomber.          The game's missions take place between the early raids in 1942 and the costly deep-penetration raids of autumn 1943. This was the period in which the 8th Air Force was developing high-altitude daylight bombing strategy and tactics while a seasoned Luftwaffe took advantage of the 8th Air Force's lack of long-range fighter escort and experience. Even with the then top-secret Norden bomb sight and intimidating B-17 combat ""boxes"" (i.e. close formation flying to allow mutual protection for B-17s and more concentrated bombing patterns) flak, bad weather and determined Luftwaffe attacks resulted in only a few of the bombs hitting the target which is clearly represented in the simulation.","['Board games introduced in 1983', 'Avalon Hill games', 'World War II board wargames']"
564181,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564181,The Church (band),"The Church are an Australian psychedelic rock band formed in Sydney in 1980. Initially associated with new wave, neo-psychedelia and indie rock, their music later came to feature slower tempos and surreal soundscapes reminiscent of dream pop and post-rock. Glenn A. Baker has written that ""From the release of the 'She Never Said' single in November 1980, this unique Sydney-originated entity has purveyed a distinctive, ethereal, psychedelic-tinged sound which has alternatively found favour and disfavor in Australia"". The ""Los Angeles Times"" has described the band's music as ""dense, shimmering, exquisite guitar pop"".          The founding members were Steve Kilbey on lead vocals and bass guitar, Peter Koppes and Marty Willson-Piper on guitars and Nick Ward on drums. Ward only played on their debut album and the band's drummer for the rest of the 1980s was Richard Ploog. Jay Dee Daugherty (ex-Patti Smith Group) played drums from 1990 to 1993, followed by Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) who remains with them to the present day. Koppes left the band from 1992 to 1997 and Willson-Piper left in 2013. He was replaced by Ian Haug, formerly of Powderfinger. Kilbey, Koppes and Powles also recorded together as """" in 1997.          The Church's debut album, ""Of Skins and Heart"" (1981), delivered their first radio hit ""The Unguarded Moment"" and they were signed to major labels in Australia, Europe and the United States. However, the US label was dissatisfied with their second album and dropped the band without releasing it. This put a dent in their international success, but they returned to the charts in 1988, with the album ""Starfish"" and the US Top 40 hit ""Under the Milky Way"". Subsequent mainstream success has proved elusive, but the band retains a large international cult following and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in Sydney in 2011. The Church continue to tour and record, releasing their 24th studio album, ""Further/Deeper"", in October 2014.          Singer, songwriter and bass guitarist Steve Kilbey first played with guitarist Peter Koppes in a glam rock band called Baby Grande in Canberra, Australia in the mid-1970s. After each had left to travel and play in other bands including Tactics (Kilbey) and Limazine (Koppes), they met again in Sydney in March 1980 and formed the initial three-piece version of The Church, with Limazine drummer Nick Ward. The name was a shortened version of the original name proposed by Kilbey: ""The Church of Man"". A month later, Marty Willson-Piper, originally from Liverpool, United Kingdom, witnessed one of their gigs and met Kilbey afterwards. That same night he was invited to join the band on guitar, establishing the classic two guitar formation.          A four-song demo was recorded in Kilbey's bedroom studio and sent, through contacts from his and Koppes's old band Baby Grande, to the Australian branch of The Beatles' publishing company, ATV Northern Songs. The song ""Chrome Injury"" attracted the attention of managing director Chris Gilbey, who signed the band to his recently formed record production company, in association with EMI and their recently resurrected Parlophone label. Gilbey went to band rehearsals and helped shape their sound – he bought Willson-Piper a 12 string Rickenbacker guitar and equipped Koppes with an Echolette tape delay. Of that first batch of demos, only ""Chrome Injury"" would go on to be recorded for release.          The band's debut album, ""Of Skins and Heart"", was recorded late in 1980, produced by Gilbey and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Seven of the nine tracks were written solely by Kilbey and two co-written with others. The first single, ""She Never Said"", was released in November, but did not chart. At the start of 1981, Ward was replaced on drums by Richard Ploog. He was recruited by their manager, Michael Chugg, after hearing of his reputation in Adelaide. Ploog's arrival established The Church's first stable line-up. The second single ""The Unguarded Moment"", co-written by Kilbey and Michelle Parker, was issued alongside the album in March 1981, but only in Australia initially. ""The Unguarded Moment"" became an Australian top ten hit, reaching No. 22 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, while ""Of Skins and Heart"" went gold, achieving the same position on the related Albums Chart. To promote their releases, the band undertook their first national tour.          The first recordings with Ploog were released as a five-track double 7"" EP, ""Too Fast for You"", in July. It included the first collectively written track, ""Sisters"". Another track, ""Tear It All Away"", later released as a separate single, showed a development towards the more elaborate guitar structures which would become part of their signature sound. Their image and sound now evoked comparisons with 1960s psychedelic groups, with tight jeans, paisley shirts and Byrds-style jangly guitars.          ""Of Skins and Heart""s commercial success enabled Gilbey to present the release to Freddie Cannon of French label Carrere and Rupert Perry of U.S. label Capitol. Both labels released the album in 1982, renaming it simply ""The Church"" and slightly altering the track listing to include songs from ""Too Fast for You"" and using a crop of that EP's artwork as the cover. ""The Church"" peaked at No. 7 in the New Zealand Albums Chart and No. 13 in Sweden. Ploog was incorrectly credited as the sole drummer on the release, despite only playing on one or three tracks, depending on the version. Capitol also released an edited single version of ""The Unguarded Moment"", without the band's approval.          The second album, ""The Blurred Crusade"", was issued in March 1982 and was both produced and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Sonically and stylistically more complex than the debut, it is ""a smoother, fuller release"", which showed the clear influence of 1960s psychedelia. ""With its mystical lyrics the second album ... brought the group's own style more into focus"". The album peaked at No. 10 and its first single, ""Almost With You"" resulted in a second Top 30 hit, peaking at No. 21.          The Church undertook a second Australian tour, while Carrere released the album in Europe, generating enough sales for them to tour there in October. However, Capitol declined to release ""The Blurred Crusade"" in North America and demanded that they write more radio-friendly material, as exemplified by their stable-mates Little River Band, which horrified the band. After another recording session, five new songs were offered to Capitol but the label was still unimpressed and dropped the band. The five songs were later released in Australia as the EP ""Sing-Songs"", which reached the Top 100 Albums Chart in December. Meanwhile, their manager, Michael Chugg, arranged a U.K. tour supporting the hugely successful pop group Duran Duran, but after eight gigs The Church pulled out, feeling that the audiences were unsympathetic. Chugg later recalled, ""They were hard work. All four of them were strong-willed and had their own ideas of how things should be."" The band also toured Scandinavia and Europe in 1982, and both of their albums were released there to critical acclaim.          In May 1983, the band released their third album, ""Seance"", co-produced by The Church and engineer John Bee (Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, The Divinyls), which peaked at No. 18. It used more keyboards and synthesisers and was typically described as ""That stark release [which] explored the band's darker side, and [whose] tracks ... were awash with strings and other effects"". The accompanying live shows included a guest keyboardist, Melbourne-based session player Dean Walliss.          For ""Seance"" the band employed mixing engineer Nick Launay, who had worked with Midnight Oil. He favoured a gated reverb drum sound, popular in the 1980s, which produced a staccato-like snare sound. Unsatisfied with the sound, the band asked Launay to redo the mix, but the effect was only lightened. The first single, ""Electric Lash"" featured this effect especially prominently and it was likened to a ""machine gun"". Despite dissatisfaction over the mix, ""Seance"" featured a lusher, more atmospheric Church with highlights including ""Now I Wonder Why"" and ""Fly"". Internationally, the album sold poorly, being considered dark and cryptic, and the general public seemed to lose interest. Some critics in Europe and the U.S. did like the album however, with ""Creem"" hailing the band as ""one of the best in the world"".          ""Seance"" was again dominated by Kilbey's song writing. Some 20 songs were put together on his home 4-track. Only one band composition made the album: the experimental ""Travel by Thought"". Kilbey and Willson-Piper had co-written another track, ""10,000 Miles"", but the label rejected it. Kilbey was upset by the label's interference, finding the track essential to their live set (it would be included on their next EP). Despite the difficulties, the album yielded two minor hits - ""It's No Reason"" and ""Electric Lash"" - and stayed in the British independent charts for several months.          The band had built a devoted fan base with their paisley shirts, catchy melodies and solid live performances. Following the release of ""Seance"", they toured Australia and New Zealand for the rest of the year to pay off debts incurred on the European tour. Meanwhile, Capitol Records released their first album in Canada, where it reached the Top 20. The ""Sing-Songs"" EP also became one of the bestselling Canadian imports of 1983.          Foregoing a full album, the band released two EPs in 1984, ""Remote Luxury"" in March and ""Persia"" in August, but only in Australia and New Zealand. Both EPs reached the Top 50 on the Australian Albums Chart. Again, almost all tracks were written by Kilbey, but compared to ""Seance"", the atmosphere was lighter and less gloomy. The band's trademark guitar sound was complemented by the keyboards of guest musicians Davey Ray Moor (from The Crystal Set, which included Kilbey's brother Russell) and Craig Hooper (from The Reels), who joined as an auxiliary member. Hooper soon left to form The Mullanes.          The band then signed to Warner Bros. Records in the United States. Internationally the two EPs were repackaged as a single album titled ""Remote Luxury"". Its U.S. release was their first record there since the debut album – although ""The Blurred Crusade"" and ""Seance"" had sold well on import. Due to the interest raised in the U.S., they left Michael Chugg Management in Sydney and signed with Malibu Management's owner John Lee. They toured the USA in October and November and while venues in New York and Los Angeles saw audiences of about 1000 people, other gigs had as few as 50. In financial terms the tour went poorly and the band lost thousands of dollars a week.          The Church seemed to reach a nadir in 1984. Unable to repeat the commercial success of the first two albums, there was a perception that their creativity was declining. Kilbey later said: ""I think we released a few dud records that weren't as good as they should have been, after ""The Blurred Crusade"" ... The band was just drifting along in a sea of apathy, I was writing not-so-good songs and the band wasn't playing them very well, so everyone's enthusiasm just waned"".          The start of 1985 was quiet for the band as members spent time apart in Stockholm, Sydney and Jamaica. Kilbey's debut solo single, ""This Asphalt Eden"", was released by EMI Parlophone and he was also the producer on a single, ""Benefit of the Doubt"", for The Crystal Set.          The Church reconvened at Studios 301 in mid 1985 to work on their next album, ""Heyday"", with British producer/engineer Peter Walsh (Simple Minds, Scott Walker, Peter Gabriel). Their first single in almost two years, ""Already Yesterday"", appeared in October and just made the Top 100. ""Heyday"" followed in November and brought new stylistic elements with the addition of real strings and horns, creating a warm, organic sound. The songs ""were among the richest moments in The Church canon"". While Kilbey still wrote the lyrics, the band were now largely writing the music together, a practice which they would continue thereafter.          Released in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US, the album was warmly received. In Australia it peaked at No. 19, and appeared on the U.S. ""Billboard"" 200. A promotional tour started in April 1986, with concerts both at home and abroad. Unexpectedly, Willson-Piper suddenly quit mid-tour after rising in-band tensions and on 10 July, The Church performed as a three-piece in Hamburg, Germany. Willson-Piper returned within a week after Kilbey agreed that future releases would contain more group efforts.          Despite the charged atmosphere and warm press, low sales for the album's singles in Australia prompted EMI to drop them. Plans for a double live album, ""Bootleg"", were also scrapped. Since the band had greater sales overseas than in Australia, they decided to record in a studio abroad and opted for a four album deal with U.S. label Arista Records in 1987. For Australian releases they signed with Mushroom Records.          Recording sessions in Los Angeles, with producers Waddy Wachtel (Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Robbie Williams) and Greg Ladanyi (Warren Zevon, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac), were a new challenge according to Kilbey, ""It was Australian hippies versus West Coast guys who know the way they like to do things. We were a bit more undisciplined than they would have liked"". Personality clashes occurred as the two sides bickered over guitar sounds, song structures and work ethic. Under pressure from the producers, Kilbey took vocal lessons, an experience he later regarded as valuable.          The stress of living in the US influenced their recording, and left Kilbey feeling out of place: Album tracks such as ""North, South, East and West,"" ""Lost,"" ""Reptile"" and ""Destination"" bore the imprint of the faces, scenery and daily life of the group's new, temporary home.          Four weeks of gruelling rehearsal resulted in ""Starfish"", which focused on capturing the band's core sound. Bright, spacious and uncluttered, the recording was a departure from the layered orchestrations of ""Heyday"". The group wanted as live and dynamic an album as possible, Willson-Piper said that trying to record a live atmosphere lacked a real gig's sense of ""being there"". They found the results bare and simplistic; however, the public reception was unexpected.          Released in February 1988, ""Starfish"" found its way into the mainstream, marking a new worldwide commercial peak for the band. It reached No. 11 in Australia and Top 50 in the US. The album was awarded a gold record in December 1992 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Also released in February, the single ""Under the Milky Way"" reached #24 on the US Hot 100, #22 in Australia and entered the Canadian Top 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the ""Billboard"" Mainstream Rock Tracks. The track was written by Kilbey and then-girlfriend Karin Jansson (ex-Pink Champagne). A near-five minute video received airtime on music television programs. ""Under the Milky Way"" won an ARIA Award in 1989 for 'Single of the Year'. In 2008, readers of ""The Australian"" voted it the best Australian song of the last 20 years. In response Kilbey said, ""it's not really about anything at all. I just wanted to create an atmosphere and I didn't even put a lot of thought into that. History has given it something that it never really had"".          A second single from ""Starfish"", ""Reptile"", charted on the Australian Top 100 in August and ""Billboard"" Mainstream charts.          EMI responded with a double compilation album, ""Hindsight 1980-1987"", which contained selections from the band's previous albums, together with hitherto-uncollected singles and B-sides. It peaked in the ARIA Top 40 Albums Chart in July.          The Church promoted ""Starfish"" with a nine-month tour before they returned to the studio for a follow-up. With a US Top 50 album under their belt, there was pressure from Arista to create another. The band started negotiations with former Led Zeppelin bass guitarist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, who had a reputation as a sophisticated producer, but the record company and management vetoed their suggestion. In an attempt to duplicate the success of ""Starfish"", The Church returned to Los Angeles with Waddy Wachtel producing.          While the previous sessions were tense, these were volatile. Already unenthusiastic about the forced pairing, there was the stress of having to create another hit album, and this took its toll. All members were outspoken about the role that drugs played in The Church’s creative process, but drummer Richard Ploog began to retreat further into his own habit, as pressure increased. The number of attempted studio takes spiralled and Ploog's relationship with Kilbey deteriorated, accentuated by Wachtel's demands for a consistently reliable tempo. Eventually Ploog's isolation led to exclusion and his drum tracks were replaced by rigid, but meter-perfect, programmed drums on all but three tracks. He left the band after the sessions.          The resulting album, ""Gold Afternoon Fix"", while different from its predecessor, reached No.12 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. While ""Starfish"" focused on a raw, live sound, ""Gold Afternoon Fix"" employed more ambient aspects, including piano, acoustic guitars and keyboards. On some tracks, the music was punctuated by clanging metal, rustling wind or sharp, industrial sounds.          ""Gold Afternoon Fix"" was heavily backed by a promotional campaign from Arista and the band went on tour, hiring Patti Smith's drummer, Jay Dee Daugherty. The album spawned a hit single, ""Metropolis"" (No. 19 in Australia, No. 11 on U.S. Mainstream Rock), but the follow-up, ""You're Still Beautiful"", did not chart. Ultimately, the album's sales were lower than ""Starfish""'s and press was mixed. The band, particularly Kilbey, would later dismiss the album as ""lousy"", ""hashed together"" and ""hideous"", although many of the songs have since become fixtures in the band's setlists.          After the dust had settled on ""Gold Afternoon Fix"", The Church returned to their old haunt at Sydney's Studios 301 to commence work on their next album. With lowered commercial expectations and less pressure from Arista, the atmosphere was more relaxed. Bringing in British producer Gavin MacKillop (Barenaked Ladies, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Straitjacket Fits) to supervise the sessions, the band began to improvise the framework for the next set of songs. The use of opium and, for Kilbey, heroin, saw the material take on a more expansive and surreal quality while Daugherty's jazzier approach on drums was a fresh change.          ""Priest=Aura"", titled from Kilbey's misreading of a Spanish fan's English vocabulary notes ('priest' = 'cura'), contains fourteen songs, many over six minutes long, and was their longest album yet at 65 minutes. With song concepts derived from cryptic, one-word working titles (an idea originally proposed by Willson-Piper), the lyrics leaned towards the abstract and esoteric. Emphasising free association and undirected coincidence between music and motif, Kilbey declined to define their meanings. Sonically, the music had numerous layers, courtesy of numerous guitar overdubs and MacKillop's rich production. The interplay between Koppes and Willson-Piper dominated throughout, especially on tracks such as ""Ripple,"" ""Kings,"" and the epic, aptly titled ""Chaos"", whose lyrics were a reflection of Steve Kilbey's unsettled lifestyle at the time.          Upon its release on 10 March 1992, ""Priest=Aura"" was given a mixed reception. It peaked in the ARIA Top 30, but reviews were varied, with some critical and others uncertain how to react. The band only went on a limited tour, confined to Australia, as Kilbey prepared for the birth of his twin daughters with Karin Jansson.          Adding to the decline in The Church's outlook was the announcement of Koppes' departure. His decision reflected two main factors: that the band had earned nothing for the two-week tour of Australia, and that he felt shut out of the creative process - a long-standing complaint that stretched back at least as far as Seance, if not further. Despite a completely sold-out tour, increasing personality conflicts within the band, especially with Willson-Piper, and frustration over their lack of success had made the situation intolerable. Despite its muted reception at the time of release, ""Priest=Aura"" is considered by both the band and fan base to be an artistic high point. In his 2014 autobiography, ""Something Quite Peculiar"", Kilbey calls it their ""undisputed masterpiece"".          Despite the loss of Koppes, Arista decided to stand by their contract and back another Church album and so Kilbey and Willson-Piper began to write new material. When it became clear that Daugherty would not be returning to the fold either, the remaining two took the opportunity to approach their music from new perspectives, abandoning their long-established roles and stylistic elements in favour of experimentation, spontaneity and electronica.          Early in 1994, the two brought in Willson-Piper's childhood friend Andy 'Dare' Mason to produce, record and mix. The album was mostly recorded at Sydney's Karmic Hit Studios and mixed at Karmic Hit and Studios 301. New Zealand drummer Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) was hired for the sessions, having already played with Kilbey on his Jack Frost project. Considered temporary at the time, Powles would soon become a permanent member of the band and is still with them over 20 years later.          The resulting album, ""Sometime Anywhere"", released in May 1994, was generally well received and peaked in the Top 30. It is described as a ""rich, dark, epic release [which] picked up where ""Priest"" left off with lush, lengthy tracks"". Sales, however, were paltry and the first single, ""Two Places at Once"", did not chart. Promotion was minimal as Arista saw insufficient commercial promise in the release. With another commercially unsuccessful album on their hands, Arista did not renew The Church's contract and pulled financial support for a tour. Ambitious plans to stage full electric shows were scaled back, leaving Kilbey and Willson-Piper with only a short run of acoustic gigs as a duo.          Without a recording deal, the band's future looked bleak as Kilbey and Willson-Piper began work on new recordings in 1995. Although initially a two-man project, the new material saw input from new drummer Powles and hired violinist Linda Neil. Renewed contact between Kilbey and Peter Koppes led to the latter agreeing to guest on four songs - a welcome surprise for fans. Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi) was drafted in to co-produce, engineer and mix the sessions. The music saw a return to guitar-based material, infused with krautrock and art rock influences. A 15-minute atmospheric piece called ""Magician Among the Spirits"" dominated the sessions, named after a book by Harry Houdini. Additional contributions by Utungun Percussion added a new, primal aspect to several songs.          The album, also called ""Magician Among the Spirits"", received mixed reviews, despite the guitar rock hook of its single, ""Comedown"". It was released on the band's own ""Deep Karma"" label, but due to financial constraints they had to arrange for outside distribution for the North American and European markets. This almost doomed the album from the beginning, but worse events were to come. Within a short time, the U.S. distributor went bankrupt, leaving the band stripped of its earnings from North American sales. Although exact figures remain unknown due to disputes, up to A$250,000 worth of merchandise (some 25,000 discs) was lost. For a band already on shaky ground, this was nearly the death knell. Comments by Kilbey in May of that year summed up the situation: ""There's no immediate future for The Church...Our management, the whole thing is broken down...We don't really have a label. We're owed lots and lots of money and we're broke. We're trying to pursue lawyers to get our money back. Marty and I aren't having any communication. There's no one really managing us so...that could have been the last record.""          Following the commercial failure of ""Magician Among the Spirits"", the members of The Church turned their attention to other projects and Willson-Piper left Australia again in order to collaborate with other artists and write new solo material. In his absence, Kilbey, Powles and Koppes spent some studio time together and quickly wrote and recorded an album as The Refo:mation. Loose in feel, but rich in atmosphere, the eccentrically-titled ""Pharmakoi/Distance-Crunching Honchos With Echo Units"" saw a greater focus on concise, guitar-dominated songs, in contrast to the experimentation of ""Magician Among the Spirits"".          Group tensions within The Church proper were still simmering, however. More than anyone else, it was new drummer Tim Powles who tried to alleviate the outstanding disagreements. While Koppes and Willson-Piper had already had differences for some time, Kilbey and Willson-Piper's relationship was also strained by recent problems. Kilbey declared that the end was nigh: after a final, worthy swan song, with the working title ""Au Revoir Por Favor"", the Church would be put to rest. The four agreed to play a string of farewell concerts around Australia, which turned out to be extremely successful. The roaring success of the intended ""final concert"" in Sydney put a quick end to talk of the band's demise.          The results of the new recording sessions saw a return to the band's roots: the material was once again based around Koppes and Willson-Piper's guitar interplay. Also, for the first time, the band completely produced itself, under Powles' aegis. Originally given the name ""Bastard Universe"", the forthcoming album was re-titled ""Hologram of Allah"" after Willson-Piper found the original too negative. Concerns about fundamentalist Muslim reaction to the potentially blasphemous title made the band finally opt for the more neutral ""Hologram of Baal"", after the Canaanite god. Released under a new contract with UK independent label Cooking Vinyl, the album was distributed in the U.S. by Thirsty Ear. A limited edition featured a bonus disc with a nearly 80-minute continuous improvised instrumental, which received the original title of the album, ""Bastard Universe"".          The reformed and rejuvenated band went on their first fully electric tour of the U.S., Australia and Europe in many years. A plan to release a live album called ""Bag of Bones"" was put into motion, but then cancelled.          Instead, a collection of cover songs was recorded, shedding light on the band's influences. Arriving in August 1999 - less than a year after ""Hologram of Baal"" - ""A Box of Birds"" contained an unusual selection of songs from Ultravox and Iggy Pop to The Monkees and Neil Young. The insert for the CD was designed as interchangeable, with 10 separate sleeve designs created by fans. As with ""Hologram of Baal"", a tour followed the album's release, but a new drama hit the band mid-tour in New York City when Kilbey was arrested for trying to purchase heroin. The band was forced to improvise a set after he failed to show, with Willson-Piper covering vocals. A night in jail and a day's community service on the Manhattan subway were Kilbey's only punishment. ""A drug bust is something every aging rock star should have under his belt"", he was later quoted as saying.          In 2001, ""Under the Milky Way"" was featured in the cult classic film Donnie Darko, helping to raise the band's profile once again. However, recording for their next album turned out to be painstakingly slow, due to numerous side projects and simple geography. With Kilbey now living in Sweden, Willson-Piper in England and the others in Australia, the bandmates met across several separate sessions. Partially recorded in both Sweden and Australia, the resulting ""After Everything Now This"", released in January 2002, saw a focus on the softer elements of the band. With only three obvious ""rock"" tracks out of ten, gentler moods dominated. The album achieved the biggest international success for The Church in almost ten years. The successive world tour featured the band in a more subtle setting as well, with most tracks performed primarily acoustically alongside guest David Lane on piano.          Fans would not have to wait long for another group release. The double-disc remix/outtakes set ""Parallel Universe"" hit stores in late 2002. Unique among the band's catalogue, the first disc, subtitled ""remixture"", featured a reshuffled, remixed, electronic version of the ""After Everything Now This"" album, the result of Tim Powles' collaboration with Sydney EDM musicians. The second disc, subtitled ""mixture"", compiled leftover songs from the ""After Everything Now This"" recording sessions.          Around the time that ""Parallel Universe"" was released, the Church had returned to the studio to record yet another album, eventually titled ""Forget Yourself"". Rather than fleshing the songs out over a long, gradual process, the band decided to keep the music as close to the original jam-based material as possible. Stylistically, this made for a much rawer sound, primarily recorded live and with minimal overdubs. As had become routine since ""Sometime Anywhere"", songs saw numerous instrument changes between members, with Powles playing guitar on ""Sealine"" and Willson-Piper switching to drums on ""Maya"". ""Forget Yourself"" was engineered and Co-Produced by Nic Hard and was released in Australia in October 2003 and in the U.S. in February 2004. The band toured extensively to support the album in Australia, the U.S. and Europe.          Their prolific output continued into 2004 with the release of three ancillary albums. Under the guidance of manager Kevin Lane Keller - an American fan and marketing professor who had been working with them since 2001 - the Church began capitalizing on the advantages offered by the internet and the independent music industry. First, in August, came the entirely improvised album ""Jammed"", containing just two long tracks and available exclusively from the band's website. Next, in October, came their third outtakes album, ""Beside Yourself"", covering the ""Forget Yourself"" sessions. Finally, only six weeks later, came ""El Momento Descuidado"", in which the band presented old and new material in an acoustic setting, for the Liberation Blue label. The title was a rough tongue-in-cheek translation of ""The Unguarded Moment"", a version of which was included. A short acoustic tour followed in late 2004 which initiated a new practice amongst the band members: that of swapping instruments on stage. The album was eventually nominated in 2005 for ""Best Adult Contemporary Album"" at the Australian ARIA Music Awards, although it did not win.          In 2005 The Church returned to full electric mode and began work on new material once again. The first release from these sessions was the outtakes album ""Back With Two Beasts"", released via their website as a teaser for the main album which would follow a few months later. ""Uninvited, Like the Clouds"", their 20th studio album, was released to rapturous reviews in April 2006 and was followed once again by extensive touring in Europe, the U.S. and Australia. Just prior to its release, in March, they performed ""Under the Milky Way"" with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra as part of the 2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.          In February 2007 came ""El Momento Siguiente"", a second album of acoustic re-interpretations of earlier songs plus several new compositions and a cover version of The Triffids classic ""Wide Open Road"". Later that year the band toured Australia with The Pretenders and EMI released the double CD 'best of' collection ""Deep in the Shallows - The Classic Singles Collection"".          In 2006 The Church had embarked on their third improvised music project: to provide the soundtrack for a short film based on the renowned American science fiction writer Jeff Vandermeer's novel """". The music was released in 2008 as the album ""Shriek: Excerpts From The Soundtrack"", and was the first release on their new label, Unorthodox Records, a partnership with MGM Distribution.          In February 2009 the band began the build-up to their next major studio album with the ""Coffee Hounds"" EP, which featured the original, non-album composition ""The Coffee Song"" and a cover of Kate Bush's classic ""Hounds Of Love"". The following month they released the ""Pangaea"" EP, whose title track would also be on the upcoming album.          Unorthodox Records released the album ""Untitled #23"" in Australia in March and the U.S. label Second Motion Records released it to the rest of the world shortly thereafter. A double vinyl version quickly sold out. It was band's 23rd album-length Australian release of original studio material, while Kilbey also alluded to the mystical significance of the number 23 in an interview with music publication ""Music Feeds"". Another major international tour followed, the ""So Love May Find Us"" tour, named after a non-album track from the ""Pangaea"" EP.          Coinciding with the tour, a book entitled ""No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church"" by Robert Dean Lurie was published in Australia, the US, and the UK by Verse Chorus Press. While primarily a biography of Kilbey, the book also traced the evolution of the band from his perspective. This was not an official band project but Kilbey, Koppes, and various friends and family members did participate.          On 27 November 2009, the Church released another EP, ""Operetta"". The title track was taken from ""Untitled #23"" but the remaining tracks, including the 34-minute improvisation ""Particles Matter"", were unique to this release.          In February 2010 the band announced that they would be celebrating their 30th anniversary with an acoustic tour entitled ""An Intimate Space"". In a unique programme, the band chose one song from each of their many albums and performed them in reverse chronological order. The shows included a 28-page program and the ""Deadman's Hand"" EP, which included more unreleased material from the ""Untitled #23"" sessions. The U.S. leg of the tour spanned April and May, including a performance of ""Under the Milky Way"" on KUSI News in San Diego.          In October, Second Motion Records re-released six early Church albums in the U.S., with bonus tracks and extensive liner notes by Willson-Piper, along with the ""Deep In The Shallows"" singles collection.          On 27 October 2010 The Church were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame by media commentator George Negus, while young pop singer Washington performed ""The Unguarded Moment"". After their acceptance speech, the band performed ""Under the Milky Way"" and ""Tantalized"". In November and December they continued with the Australian leg of their ""An Intimate Space"" tour.          The band traveled to the U.S. once again in February 2011 in full electric mode for the ""Future Past Perfect"" tour, performing three albums in their entirety: ""Untitled #23"", ""Priest=Aura"" & ""Starfish"". Sold-out dates were played in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Alexandria, Philadelphia, New York, Foxborough and Atlanta. This tour was the first on which the band was augmented onstage by the Australian multi-instrumentalist Craig Wilson, from the band astreetlightsong.          On 10 April The Church further celebrated their 30th anniversary with a special show entitled ""A Psychedelic Symphony"", at Sydney Opera House, which had been a year in preparation. Accompanied by conductor George Ellis and the Sydney University Symphony Orchestra, the concert was performed to a sold-out 2000+ capacity crowd and was recorded and filmed. A DVD and double CD were released by Unorthodox in June 2014, the band's first official live album. The show was also broadcast on the Australian music TV channel MAX during October 2011.          In December they concluded the ""Future Past Perfect"" tour with a dozen Australian dates. Their 17 December show at the Enmore Theatre, Sydney, was filmed and is available to stream here.          In November and December 2012, The Church played a major series of concerts across Australia and New Zealand, together with Simple Minds, Devo and Models. As part of the tour, they also played several ""A Day on the Green"" events with Models. During this tour they also played two intimate ""Art Rock 'n' Roll"" shows, one at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne and the other at the Factory Theatre in Sydney, where each member chose four songs from the band's catalogue, interspersed with a selection of concert staples.          In March 2013 there were the first signs of internal problems in the band, when Steve Kilbey issued a series of statements which indicated that he was considering leaving The Church due to a dispute over royalty payments. Then, later in the year, Kilbey announced on the band's Facebook page that Marty Willson-Piper would not be returning and had been replaced by former Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug. Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was ""not available"" for the recording of a new album and subsequent touring, and praised Haug as ""a brilliant guitarist"". Kilbey also provided a pre-emptive response to disgruntled fans: ""... if you can't dig it I'm sorry. this is my fucking band after all and it has existed at times without Peter and in the beginning without Marty. and for times in between while he went AWOL."" He also promoted sixteen ""very very fucking cool"" new songs that are ready to be recorded for the next Church album.          In early October 2014, Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was not asked to leave the band, but that he had simply not replied to the various attempts made to contact him (Willson-Piper had relocated to Sweden). Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, Kilbey said to Powles at the time, ""We have to find someone with stature. He has to have his own trip, he can’t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas."" As part of the same interview, Haug explained that he had received a phone call from Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, ""If I asked you to join The Church, what would you say?"" and ended the call after Haug's affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the ""last thing"" that would have entered his mind, but that ""it just really seemed to work"".          Entitled ""Further/Deeper"", the Church's 24th studio album was released on 17 October 2014. Recorded over a period of eight days in late 2013, ""Further/Deeper"" was produced and engineered by Powles. Writing for the ""Courier-Mail"", Noel Mengel rated the album with 4.5 stars, while Jeff Apter assigned the album 4 stars in ""Rolling Stone Australia"". The band performed the album in its entirety during the ""Further/Deeper"" tours of Australia, North America and Europe.          In July, August and September 2015 they toured Australia and the U.S. again, supporting The Psychedelic Furs on some of the U.S. dates. On this tour (when not supporting) the band played most of ""Further/Deeper"" plus ""The Blurred Crusade"" in its entirety.

15357916,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15357916,The Phenomenon of Man,"The Phenomenon of Man (""Le phénomène humain"", 1955) is a book written by the French philosopher, paleontologist and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. In this work, Teilhard describes evolution as a process that leads to increasing complexity, culminating in the unification of consciousness.          The book was finished in the 1930s, but was published posthumously in 1955. The Roman Catholic Church initially prohibited the publication of some of Teilhard’s writings on the grounds that they contradicted orthodoxy.          The foreword to the book was written by one of the key scientific advocates for natural selection and evolution of the 20th century, and a co-developer of the modern synthesis in biology, Julian Huxley.          Teilhard views evolution as a process that leads to increasing complexity. From the cell to the thinking animal, a process of psychical concentration leads to greater consciousness. The emergence of ""Homo sapiens"" marks the beginning of a new age, as the power acquired by consciousness to turn in upon itself raises humankind to a new sphere. Borrowing Huxley’s expression, Teilhard describes humankind as evolution becoming conscious of itself.          In Teilhard's conception of the evolution of the species, a collective identity begins to develop as trade and the transmission of ideas increases. Knowledge accumulates and is transmitted in increasing levels of depth and complexity. This leads to a further augmentation of consciousness and the emergence of a thinking layer that envelops the earth. Teilhard calls the new membrane the “noosphere” (from the Greek “""nous""”, meaning mind), a term first coined by Vladimir Vernadsky. The noosphere is the collective consciousness of humanity, the networks of thought and emotion in which all are immersed.           The development of science and technology causes an expansion of the human sphere of influence, allowing a person to be simultaneously present in every corner of the world. Teilhard argues that humanity has thus become cosmopolitan, stretching a single organized membrane over the Earth. Teilhard describes the process by which this happens as a ""gigantic psychobiological operation, a sort of mega-synthesis, the “super-arrangement” to which all the thinking elements of the earth find themselves today individually and collectively subject"". The rapid expansion of the noosphere requires a new domain of psychical expansion, which ""is staring us in the face if we would only raise our heads to look at it"".          In Teilhard’s view, evolution will culminate in the Omega Point, a sort of supreme consciousness. Layers of consciousness will converge in Omega, fusing and consuming them in itself. The concentration of a conscious universe will reassemble in itself all consciousnesses as well as all that we are conscious of. Teilhard emphasizes that each individual facet of consciousness will remain conscious of itself at the end of the process.          In 1961, the Nobel Prize-winner Peter Medawar, a British immunologist, wrote a scornful review of the book for the journal ""Mind"", calling it ""a bag of tricks"" and saying that the author had shown ""an active willingness to be deceived"": ""the greater part of it, I shall show, is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself"".          The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins called Medawar's review ""devastating"" , and ""The Phenomenon of Man"" ""the quintessence of bad poetic science"".          In the June 1995 issue of ""Wired"", Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg said, ""Teilhard saw the Net coming more than half a century before it arrived"":          Teilhard imagined a stage of evolution characterized by a complex membrane of information enveloping the globe and fueled by human consciousness. It sounds a little off-the-wall, until you think about the Net, that vast electronic web encircling the Earth, running point to point through a nerve-like constellation of wires.          In July 2009, during a vespers service in Aosta Cathedral in northern Italy, Pope Benedict XVI, reflecting on the Epistle to the Romans in which ""St. Paul writes that the world itself will one day become a form of living worship"", commented on Teilhard:          It's the great vision that later Teilhard de Chardin also had: At the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host. Let's pray to the Lord that he help us be priests in this sense, to help in the transformation of the world in adoration of God, beginning with ourselves.","['Biological evolution', 'French books', 'Philosophy books', 'Jesuit publications', '1955 books', 'Harper & Brothers books']"
3415010,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3415010,Navarch,"Navarch (; pronounced ""návarchos"") is a Greek word meaning ""leader of the ships"", which in some states became the title of an office equivalent to that of a modern admiral.          Not all states gave their naval commanders such a title. Athens, for instance, placed its fleet under the command of generals (""strategoi"") holding the same title as those who commanded its land forces. Such command structures reflected the fact that, especially early in the Classical period, fleets operated in close conjunction with land forces, and indeed, the title of navarch did not begin to appear until the time of the Peloponnesian War, when fleets began to operate more independently. This separate title was originally used in cities that lacked an established naval tradition, Sparta being the most prominent, but entered broader use later, being adopted by the navies of the Hellenistic era states such as Macedon, Syracuse, Ptolemaic and Seleucid Empire, Achaean League, and Rhodes.          At Sparta and many other city-states, the position was held for one year only (a situation that compelled the Spartans to resort to an elaborate legal fiction when they wished to reinstate Lysander for more than one year in command). Admirals of despotic or monarchic states, however, could serve for years at a time. At Sparta, the position, unlike most high-level offices, was available to men from outside the Spartiate class; Lysander, the most famous occupant of the office, was a beneficiary of this rule.          ""Nauarchus"", a direct transliteration of the Greek term into Latin, was also used by the Roman Navy for its squadron commanders. The Greek-speaking Byzantines sometimes used the term to designate the captains of ships; the terms ""drungarios"" or ""strategos"" were used to designate their admirals.          In the modern Hellenic Navy, ""návarchos"" is the highest rank, equivalent to full admiral. All but one of the remaining flag ranks are also derivations of this word: ""Antinávarchos"" (αντιναύαρχος, ""deputy-admiral"") is the equivalent to vice admiral and ""yponávarchos"" (υποναύαρχος, ""under-admiral""), equivalent to rear admiral, while ""archiploíarchos"" is the equivalent of commodore. The same ranks are also used by the Hellenic Coast Guard. The rank of full ""návarchos"" is held in active service only by the Chief of the General Staff of National Defence, when he is a naval officer, and given to the Chiefs of the Hellenic Navy General Staff on retirement. Under the Greek monarchy, the five-star rank of ""archinávarchos"" (αρχιναύαρχος), equivalent to grand admiral or admiral of the fleet, existed, and was held only by the reigning monarch (Kings George II, Paul and Constantine II).","['Naval ranks', 'Ancient Greek titles', 'Hellenic Navy', 'Military ranks of ancient Greece', 'Military ranks of Greece', 'Military ranks of Sparta', 'Military ranks of ancient Macedon']"
15643493,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15643493,Bagne of Toulon,"The Bagne of Toulon was the notorious prison in Toulon, France, made famous as the place of imprisonment of Jean Valjean, the hero of ""Les Misérables"", the novel by Victor Hugo. The Bagne was opened in 1748 and closed in 1873.          The bagne was created by an ordinance of King Louis XV in 1748 to house the convicts who had previously been sentenced to row the galleys of the French Mediterranean fleet. The name 'bagne' came from the Italian word ""bagno"", or bath, the name of a prison in Rome which had formerly been a Roman bath.          Since the 15th century, French prisoners had been sentenced to serve on the galleys, sometimes even for minor crimes. By the eighteenth century, cannons and changes in modern naval warfare had made the galleys obsolete, and the use of galleys for punishment was stopped. The prisoners were first transferred to a group of ships tied up at the arsenal and port of Toulon, which were called the ""bagne flottant"" (the floating prison.) Then, new buildings were constructed on the shore in the Arsenal, between the Nouvelle Darse (new port) and Vieille Darse (old port.) Other bagnes were created in Brest and Rochefort.          Though there were no more galleys being built, prisoners continued to be sent to Toulon. The convicts were used for digging earth and construction work, both in the Arsenal and in the town. They also provided labor for the big treadmills used in spinning ropes in the Corderie, or rope factory, of the Arsenal.          The costumes of the prisoners consisted of a white shirt, yellow trousers, red vest and smock and a cap which had different colors depending on the sentence duration. Those sentenced to life imprisonment wore green caps, all the others red caps. Because of the similarity to the Phrygian cap, these were abolished for a short time during the French revolution. Before the French Revolution and again after 1810, the prisoners were also branded on the shoulder with a hot iron, using the letters ""TF"" (""travaux forcés"", hard labour) and ""TFP"" (""travaux forcés à perpétuité"", hard labour for life). One of their feet, typically the right one, was encircled with a ring of iron attached to a short chain, so that they could be immobilized. The most hardened criminals were chained two on two. An iron ball attached to the leg was used as a punishment for some times in the late 18th century, as was flogging with a tarred or knotted rope. These punishments were made less severe as the years passed.          The diet of the prisoners consisted of a small amount of meat and a ration of wine for the workers, and a large amount of dried vegetables, particularly beans. The prisoners used the word 'gourgane' (the word for 'beans' in the provençal language) to refer to the guards.          Since the sanitary conditions of the prison were extremely poor, a hospital was built within the prison in 1777 in the casemates of the southeast rampart of the Darse Vauban, and later additional buildings were added adjoining the rampart. In 1897 the hospital was moved to a much larger building, 200 meters long, which was built on the west quay of the ""Vieille Darse"" or old port, called the ""Grand Rang"". This building had a very large ground floor with a vaulted ceiling with three bays. The hospital occupied the upper floor. Two square towers with pyramid-shaped roofs were built at the north and south ends of the building. The rest of the building was occupied by administrative offices.          The healthy prisoners were originally housed along the west quay, where the hospital was eventually built. In 1814, they were moved to another building 115 meters long, oriented east-west, perpendicular to the hospital, which had been built in 1783 on the southwest quay of the Old Port, between the chain which blocked the entrance to the port and the ""Grand Rang"". Next to this building a ship was moored, called the ""Amiral"", which guarded the entrance to the port and fired a cannon shot each morning and each evening.          In 1836 the Bagne held 4,305 prisoners, of which 1,193 were sentenced to life imprisonment; 173 to more than twenty years imprisonment; 382 to terms between sixteen and twenty years; 387 to terms between eleven and fifteen years; 1469 to terms of between five and ten years; and 700 to terms of less than five years.          A few of the ""bagnards"", or prisoners, were well-known, notably a famous imposter named Coignard, who pretended to be the Count of St. Helena, and Eugène François Vidocq (23 July 1775 – 11 May 1857) a French criminal who later became the first director of Sûreté Nationale and one of the first modern private investigators, and who may have been the model for both Javert and Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.          At the beginning of the Second Empire of Napoleon III (Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte), the government decided to close the prisons at the naval ports, which were considered undesirable and expensive to run. It was therefore decided to replace the so-called ""bagnes métropolitains"", the prisons within cities, with transportation to French Guyana (with the central administration in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni and Devil's Island mainly used for political prisoners) and later also to Nouméa in French New Caledonia. The bagnes of Rochefort and Brest were closed in 1852 and 1858 respectively, but Toulon, the largest, took longer to empty.           By 1873, the bagne had become too expensive to operate, and the workers were too unskilled and required too many guards to be of practical use. The bagne was closed, and the buildings were used for various military purposes. They survived until 1944, when the bagne was almost entirely destroyed by an Allied bombing raid. All that remains today is a single small building and a fragment of wall, on the southeast side of the Darse Vauban.          Besides Jean Valjean, several other characters in French literature spent time in the Bagne of Toulon:          Taken from the French-language Wikipedia article bagne de Toulon, and from the descriptive texts of the permanent exhibit on the bagne in Fort Balaguier.

Directed by Terence Young, later involved with some of the early James Bond films. Christopher Lee appears in a small role in the film.          The plot revolves around Johnny Solo (Leo Genn), the owner of the ""Pink Flamingo"" club in London's Soho area, and his battles with rival club owner Diamonds Dielli (Sheldon Lawrence) and the police. When the tough entrepreneur starts getting threats and demands for protection, he fights back.          Johnny's girlfriend Midnight Franklin (Jayne Mansfield), one of the club's headliners, wants to get him out of the business. In the background are a sadistic client, an underage chorus girl, a wisecracking siren who's not averse to rough trade, a visiting journalist, and a dancer who guards her past.          The reporter gets involved in the strip scene while writing a story on the clubs, and in the end he has quite a lot to write about. The competition between the two clubs heats up. Johnny becomes an unknowing instrument in the death of the chorus girl. Midnight informs on him to save his life from the violent blackmailers after him. Both rival clubs head for a crash.          ""Too Hot to Handle"" was Jayne Mansfield's first film away from 20th Century Fox after achieving stardom in the mid-1950s. By 1960, however, Mansfield's box office popularity had faded, and Fox loaned her (as they did others) to foreign studios while they awaited a good film for her. This British drama is usually marked as the beginning of her descent into low-budget productions.          The film was billed as ""an exposé of 'sexy, sordid Soho, England's greatest shame'"".          Notorious in its day because Mansfield's risqué see-through clothing and racy musical numbers caused some controversy, holding up the American release until January 1961, while the sexiest frames were fully displayed in ""Playboy"" magazine. For its American releases, ""Too Hot to Handle"" was retitled ""Playgirl After Dark"" and was mildly edited to meet America's censor requirements. ""Halliwell's Film and Video Guide"" describes the film as a ""rotten, hilarious British gangster film set in a totally unreal underworld and very uncomfortably cast.""          While filmed and released in Eastman Color, the VHS and DVD editions are in black-and-white for unknown reasons.","['1960 films', 'British films', 'English-language films', '1960s drama films', 'Film noir', 'Films directed by Terence Young', 'British crime films', 'Films set in London', 'Gangster films', 'British drama films']"
7453753,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7453753,Seymour H. Knox I,"Seymour Horace Knox I (April 1861 – May 17, 1915), was a Buffalo, New York businessman who made his fortune in five-and-dime stores. He merged his more than 100 stores with those of his first cousins, Frank Winfield Woolworth and Charles Woolworth, to form the F. W. Woolworth Company. He went on to hold prominent positions in the merged company as well as Marine Trust Co. He was the father of Seymour H. Knox II and grandfather of Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup Knox, the co-founders of the Buffalo Sabres in the National Hockey League.          He was born in April 1861 in Russell, Saint Lawrence County, New York. His father was James Horace Knox, a farmer married to Jane E. McBrier. James' grandfather had fought in the American Revolution. William Knox, was the first of this line of Knoxes to come to Massachusetts from Belfast, Ireland, in 1737.          Seymour attended the Russell district school and at fifteen, though he had never gone to high school, began to teach in school himself.          At seventeen he moved to Hart, Michigan, where for a few years he worked as a salesclerk. Then he left for Reading, Pennsylvania, where he entered into a partnership with his first cousins. He later donated the Knox Memorial Central School Building (dedicated on July 30, 1913) that served the town until the Knox Memorial School and Edwards Central School merged. He initially became a partner with the Woolworths by jointly opening a Reading, Pennsylvania, Woolworth & Knox store with them on September 20, 1884, using his entire life savings. The Reading store's first several hours had no sales. However, after the partners took a lunchtime walk, they returned at 1:30 to find the local factory workers had been let out at 1:00—with their paychecks. Sales were brisk, and the partners never looked back. His second store, in Newark, New Jersey, was short lived, but his partnership thrived nonetheless. The third venture, in Erie, Pennsylvania, enabled them to buy out the Newark lease. He partnered with Frank to open the first Buffalo store, at 409 Main Street, on October 13, 1888.          By 1889, he was able to buy out his cousins. He maintained a collegial business relationship with his cousins after the buyout. In fact, he bought Woolworth merchandise at wholesale and sometimes traded in competition. He formed another brief partnership with another friendly rival, Earle Perry Charlton, from 1889–1895, opening his Buffalo ""S.H. Knox Co."" 5 and 10 Cent Store in 1890. In 1890, he made established headquarters in the Buffalo store. Sources disagree on the chronology of later stores. One source says that the second Buffalo store was opened at 549 William Street on June 20, 1891. Another says Knox opened his second store on December 18, 1893, at 519 Main Street four days after the first store at 409 Main Street was destroyed in the Wonderland Building Fire. The 519 Main Street store replaced the 409 Main Street after the December 14, 1893 fire and moved to 395 Main Street in 1895. He continued to build his S.H. Knox Co. 5 and 10 Cent Store empire. By the time of the 1911 incorporation of F. W. Woolworth Company, Knox was the second largest of six store operators with 98 U.S. and 13 Canadian locations. In 1912, he received $12 million of the $65 million merger proceeds and was appointed Director and Senior Vice-Principal of the Corporation. Knox is remembered as the pioneering city center store operator. His Detroit, Michigan store was the first outside of the agricultural and small-market towns. Many of the Woolworth friendly rivals emulated his plan.          In 1913, he purchased Stephen Clement's interests in Marine National. At his death, Seymour was Vice President of the Woolworth Co. and Chairman of the Board of the Marine Trust Co. He was the first of three generations of the family to serve as Chairman.          Seymour married Grace Millard Knox (1862–1936), in 1890, and they raised three children:          Among his grandchildren were Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup R. Knox, the original principal owners of the Buffalo Sabres. Grace established The University at Buffalo's first endowment fund in 1916 when she donated $250,000. Knox bred champion trotters and pacers and was a polo enthusiast.          Knox died on May 17, 1915 in Buffalo, New York.","['1861 births', '1915 deaths', 'American businesspeople', 'Knox family', 'People from Buffalo, New York', 'Woolworth family']"

16190896,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16190896,Daylight saving time in the United States,"Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year, so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time (DST), the exceptions being Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation, which does observe daylight saving time), Hawaii, and the overseas territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.          Daylight saving time starts on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November, with the time changes taking place at 2:00 a.m. local time. With a mnemonic word play referring to seasons, clocks ""spring forward and fall back""—that is, in springtime the clocks are moved forward from 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., and in fall they are moved back from 2:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Daylight saving time lasts for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, about 65% of the entire year (even in leap years).          The following table lists recent past and near future starting and ending dates of daylight saving time in the United States:          During World War I, in an effort to conserve fuel, Germany began observing DST on May 1, 1916. The rest of Europe soon followed. The plan was not adopted in the United States until the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918, which established standard time zones and set summer DST to begin on March 31, 1918 (reverting October 27). The idea was unpopular and Congress abolished DST after the war, overriding President Woodrow Wilson's veto. DST became a local option and was observed in some states until World War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt instituted year-round DST, called ""War Time"", on February 9, 1942. It lasted until the last Sunday in September 1945. After 1945 many states and cities east of the Mississippi River (and mostly north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers) adopted summer DST.          From 1945 to 1966 there was no federal law on daylight saving time, so localities could choose when it began and ended or drop it entirely. In 1954 only California and Nevada had statewide DST west of the Mississippi, and only a few cities between Nevada and St Louis. In the 1964 Official Railway Guide, 21 of the 48 states had no DST anywhere.          By 1962 the transportation industry found the lack of consistency confusing enough to push for federal regulation. The result was the Uniform Time Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-387). Beginning in 1967, the act mandated standard time within the established time zones and provided for advanced time: clocks would be advanced one hour beginning at 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in April and turned back one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in October. States were allowed to exempt themselves from DST as long as the entire state did so. If a state chose to observe DST, the time changes were required to begin and end on the established dates. In 1967 Arizona and Michigan became the first states to exempt themselves from DST (Michigan would begin observing DST in 1972). In 1972 the act was amended (P.L. 92-267), allowing those states split between time zones to exempt either the entire state or that part of the state lying within a different time zone. The newly created Department of Transportation (DOT) was given power to enforce the law. As of 2014 the following states and territories are not observing DST: Arizona, Hawaii, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.          During the 1973 oil embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), in an effort to conserve fuel Congress enacted a trial period of year-round DST (P.L. 93-182), beginning January 6, 1974, and ending April 27, 1975. The trial was hotly debated. Those in favor pointed to increased daylight hours in the winter evening: more time for recreation, reduced lighting and heating demands, reduced crime, and reduced automobile accidents. The opposition was concerned about children leaving for school in the dark. The act was amended in October 1974 (P.L. 93-434) to return to standard time for the period beginning October 27, 1974, and ending February 23, 1975, when DST resumed. When the trial ended in 1975, the country returned to observing summer DST (with the aforementioned exceptions).          The DOT, evaluating the plan of extending DST into March, reported in 1975 that ""modest overall benefits might be realized by a shift from the historic six-month DST (May through October) in areas of energy conservation, overall traffic safety and reduced violent crime."" However, DOT also reported that these benefits were minimal and difficult to distinguish from seasonal variations and fluctuations in energy prices.          Congress then asked the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) to evaluate the DOT report. Its report, ""Review and Technical Evaluation of the DOT Daylight Saving Time Study"" (April 1976), found no significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities. It did find statistically significant evidence of increased fatalities among school-age children in the mornings during the four-month period January–April 1974 as compared with the same period (non-DST) of 1973. NBS stated that it was impossible to determine, what, if any, of this increase was due to DST. When these data were compared between 1973 and 1974 for the months of March and April, no significant difference was found in fatalities among school-age children in the mornings.          In 1986 Congress enacted P.L. 99-359, amending the Uniform Time Act by changing the beginning of DST to the first Sunday in April and having the end remain the last Sunday in October. These start and end dates were in effect from 1987 to 2006. The time was adjusted at 2:00 a.m. local time.          By the Energy Policy Act of 2005, daylight saving time (DST) was extended in the United States beginning in 2007. As of that year, DST begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. These changes result in a DST period that is five weeks longer than previously in years where April 1 falls on Monday through Wednesday and four weeks longer than previously in years where April 1 falls on Thursday through Sunday. In 2008 daylight saving time ended at 2:00 a.m. DST (0200) (1:00 a.m. ST) on Sunday, November 2, and in 2009 it began at 2:00 a.m. (3:00 a.m. DST) on Sunday, March 8. Wyoming Senator Michael Enzi and Michigan Representative Fred Upton advocated the extension from October into November especially to allow children to go trick-or-treating in more daylight.          Under Section 110 of the Act, the U.S. Department of Energy was required to study the impact of the 2007 DST extension no later than nine months after the change took effect. The report, released in October 2008, reported a nationwide electricity savings of 0.03% for the year of 2007.          An October 2008 study conducted by the University of California at Santa Barbara for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the 2006 DST adoption in Indiana increased energy consumption in Indiana by an average of 1%. Although energy consumption for lighting dropped as a result of the DST adoption, consumption for heating and cooling increased by 2 to 4%. The cost to the average Indiana household of the DST adoption was determined to be $3.29 per year, for an aggregate cost of $1.7 million to $5.5 million per year.          Under the Standard Time Act of 1918, as amended by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, moving a state or an area within a state from one time zone to another requires a regulation issued by DOT. The governor or state legislature may initiate a request for the state or any part of the state; the highest elected officials in the county may make a request for that county. The standard in the statute for such decisions is the convenience of commerce in that area. The convenience of commerce is defined broadly to consider such circumstances as the shipment of goods within the community; the origin of television and radio broadcasts; the areas where most residents work, attend school, worship, or receive health care; the location of airports, railway, and bus stations; and the major elements of the community's economy.          After receiving a request for altering a time zone, DOT determines whether it meets the requirement of minimum statutory criteria before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, soliciting public comment and scheduling a public hearing. Usually the hearing is held in the area requesting the change so that all affected parties can be represented. After the close of the comment period, the comments are reviewed and appropriate final action taken. If the Secretary agrees that the statutory requirement has been met, the change is instituted, usually at the next changeover to or from DST.          Under the Uniform Time Act, moving an area on or off DST is accomplished through legal action at the state level. Some states require legislation while others require executive action such as a governor's executive order. Information on procedures required in a specific state may be obtained from that state's legislature or governor's office. Although it may exempt itself, if a state decides to observe DST, the dates of observance must comply with federal legislation.          Alaska observes DST. Due to its high latitude, Alaska has nearly round-the-clock daylight during summer and DST is seen by some Alaskans as unnecessary and a nuisance. Another issue is that the Alaskan mainland's single time zone, which approximates solar time in the capital, Juneau, leads to a large disparity between civil time and solar time for much of the state, with solar noon occurring as late as 2:00 p.m. in the population centers of Anchorage and Fairbanks, and as late as 3:00 p.m. by the clock in places such as Nome. In Fairbanks, for example, sunset occurs well after civil midnight in the summer. Others argue that ending daylight saving time will place Alaska as much as five hours from Eastern Daylight Time, making coordination of travel and phone conversations more difficult.          In March 2015 the Alaska Senate passed a bill, introduced by state senator Anna MacKinnon, to end daylight saving time. The Alaska House formed a sub-committee that will look into the issue during the 2016 legislative session.          Arizona observed DST in 1967 under the Uniform Time Act because the state legislature did not enact an exemption statute that year. In March 1968 the DST exemption statute was enacted and the state of Arizona has not observed DST since 1967. This is in large part due to energy conservation: Phoenix and Tucson are among the hottest US metropolitan areas during the summer, resulting in more power usage from air conditioning units and evaporative coolers in homes and businesses. An extra hour of sunlight while people are active would cause people to run their cooling systems longer, thereby using more energy.          The Navajo Indian Reservation, which extends into two adjacent states, Utah and New Mexico, does observe daylight saving time. The Hopi Reservation, which is entirely within the state of Arizona and is an enclave of the Navajo Indian Reservation, does not observe DST.          California voters passed Proposition 12 in 1949, approving DST in the state. In February 2016, California State Assembly member Kansen Chu introduced a bill that would exempt DST in the state. Chu cites the arguments made by DST opponents, such as the little evidence that it saves energy, it increases health risks, and causes more car and workplace accidents. If the California Legislature passes this bill, it must still go before the state's voters in order to be enacted and thus repeal Proposition 12.          ""Colorado Springs Gazette"" columnist Ralph Routon wrote a series of columns in 1999 promoting placing all of Colorado on year-round DST in order to save state residents the ""aggravation of resetting their clocks every six months."" Routon mentions in his original column, several other effects, which would benefit some of the state's citizens, including him.          The idea gathered popular support in Colorado Springs and the attention of the state's larger newspapers with some attention being negative. When state Senator MaryAnne Tebedo attempted to present the idea to the state legislature, her research uncovered federal laws forbidding the state-initiated extension of daylight saving time. Still determined to relieve Coloradans of the need to change their clocks, Tebedo introduced the only bill legally permitted to her: a proposal to exempt the state of Colorado from DST. The bill did not advance from committee during the 2000 legislative session.          Daylight time is less useful in Florida than in many other states because its southern location leads to less variation in day length between winter and summer. Without DST, Miami, for instance, would experience similar sunrise and sunset times throughout the year to cities such as Honolulu or Hong Kong, both of which have abandoned DST for decades. There is opposition to DST in Florida. State senator Bill Posey introduced a bill in March 2008 to abolish daylight time in the state and keep Florida on year-round standard time. Because Florida straddles two time zones, the Florida legislature has the option of returning all or part of the state to standard time along time zone boundaries (i.e. placing the portion of the state in the Eastern time zone on standard time, while leaving the portion in the Central time zone on DST, so that the whole state had a common time).          Hawaii has never observed daylight saving time under the Uniform Time Act, having opted out of the Act's provisions in 1967.          Because of Hawaii's tropical latitude, there is not a large variation in daylight length between winter and summer. Advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, but Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's meridian and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. (Until about 1946 Hawaiian standard time was based on longitude 157.5 deg west rather than 150 deg.)          On April 26, 1933, the Territorial Legislature enacted a bill placing Hawaii on daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April (April 30 in that year) to the last Sunday in September, but the law was repealed three weeks later on May 21, 1933. During World War II between February 9, 1942 and September 30, 1945, Hawaiian Standard Time was advanced one hour to so-called ""Hawaiian War Time,"" effectively placing the territory on year-round daylight saving time.          From 1970 until 2006, most of Indiana in the Eastern Time Zone did not observe daylight saving time, but the entire state started to do so in April 2006 after eight counties in western Indiana were shifted from the Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone. One goal for observing DST was to get more Indiana counties observing the same time zone; formerly, 77 counties observed EST, 5 observed EST/EDT (the EDT usage being unofficial only), and 10 observed CST/CDT. , Indiana has 12 counties observing Central Daylight Time while the remaining 80 counties observe Eastern Daylight Time. Those counties observing CST are in two groups: one near or in the Chicago metropolitan area, and the other around Evansville in the southwest corner of the state.          In 1967 the Michigan Legislature adopted a statute, Act 6 of the Public Acts of 1967, exempting the state from the observance of DST. The exemption statute was suspended on June 14, 1967, however, when the referendum was invoked. From June 14, 1967 until the last Sunday in October, 1967, Michigan observed DST, and did so in 1968 as well. The exemption statute was submitted to the voters at the General Election held in November 1968, and, in a close vote, the exemption statute was sustained. As a result, Michigan did not observe DST in 1969, 1970, 1971, or 1972. In November 1972, an initiative measure, repealing the exemption statute, was approved by the voters. Michigan again observed DST in 1973, and has continued to do so since then.          The vast majority of Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone. Only the Upper Peninsula counties that border Wisconsin (Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee) are in Central Time.          In 2005, Nevada Assembly Bill 18 would have exempted Nevada from daylight saving time. The bill's author, Assemblyman Bob McCleary, D-North Las Vegas, argued that because of southern Nevada's desert climate, it would reduce power usage during the peak summer months by reducing the time that people would operate their home air conditioners. The result of not observing DST, however, would place the state in an odd time configuration relative to neighboring states. Because it is on the eastern edge of the Pacific Time Zone, Nevada (PST) would be two hours behind Utah (MDT), its eastern neighbor, and one hour behind California (PDT), its western neighbor. In the summer, it would therefore be the same time in Nevada (PST) as it would be in the majority of Alaska (AKDT). The bill died without a vote.          In 2015 the Nevada Senate passed Nevada Assembly Joint Resolution 4, which would make it so that Nevada remains on Daylight Saving Time throughout the year. This would mean that Nevada is on the same time as Arizona all year, but would be an hour ahead of California in the winter. The United States Congress must now approve the change.          Republican Rep. Curry Todd of Collierville has sponsored a bill to establish permanent Daylight Saving Time in Tennessee, to become effective July 2014. The bill passed out of subcommittee in mid February 2014, despite some concerns from other lawmakers. The bill was expected to go to vote by the House State Government Committee in late February. It failed to pass when voted on March 25, 2014. An amendment to the federal Uniform Time Act would be required in order for Tennessee or any other state to observe year-round daylight saving time. The federal statute mandates the period during which standard time must be observed and the period during which daylight saving time must be observed, and sets forth the circumstances under which a state may elect to observe standard time throughout the year. There is no option for a state to observe year-round daylight saving time short of DOT approval to move to another time zone.          Republican Rep. Dan Flynn authored a bill (H.B. 150) to exempt the state from observing DST. On May 8, 2015 the Texas House of Representatives voted down the proposal 56–79 due to arguments including the effects on start times for NFL games.          In 2015, State Rep. Elizabeth Scott told a House committee that the semiannual time switches are not only inconvenient but lead to health problems and accidents due to lost sleep. She added that the bill to drop daylight saving time would reduce heart attacks, car wrecks and work accidents found to increase with the sleep-schedule disruptions. Opposition to similar measures in other states has come from recreational business interests. The Golf Association for Utah told state officials that earlier night fall would cause a loss in revenues.          All U.S. insular territories with civilian government (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) lie in the tropics and do not observe DST.          While neighboring Samoa began observing DST in September 2010, the smaller American Samoa cannot legally follow because of the DST observation period mandated by the Uniform Time Act. This period is actually wintertime in this Southern Hemisphere territory.          Many computer operating systems (such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, and OS X) and programming languages (such as Java, perl, and most shell languages) allow a local time zone setting in the format of ""(standard time zone abbreviation)(UTC hour difference)(daylight saving time zone abbreviation)"". This allows programs and programming languages that must do calculations based on local time to more easily calculate differences between local time and UTC, as well as knowing whether calculations should be changed during daylight saving time. For example, a time zone setting of EST5EDT indicates that local time on the computer is 5 hours behind UTC and should be adjusted for daylight saving time.

11342184,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11342184,Caryll Houselander,"Caryll Houselander (29 September 1901 – 12 October 1954) was a lay Roman Catholic ecclesiastical artist, mystic, popular religious writer and poet.          Born in Bath, England, Houselander was the second of two daughters of Wilmott and Gertrude Provis Houselander.          Several authors, including Maisie Ward in her 1962 biography ""Caryll Houselander: That Divine Eccentric"", incorrectly state that Houselander was born on 29 October 1901 when, in fact, she was born on 29 September 1901 according to her birth certificate (cited in Andrew Cook, ""Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly"", rev. ed., 2004, p. 319, n. 27) and her remark in ""A Rocking-Horse Catholic"" (cited below, p. 41) that she took the confirmation ""name of Michael after the Archangel on whose feast day I was born.""          When Houselander was six, her mother converted to Catholicism and she in turn was so baptised. Shortly after her ninth birthday, her parents separated and her mother opened a boarding house to support the family. Houselander was sent to a convent where she reported her first mystical experience. One day, she entered a room and saw a Bavarian nun sitting by herself, weeping and polishing shoes. At this time, there was much anti-German sentiment owing to the war. As she stared, she saw the nun's head being pressed down by a crown of thorns that she was to interpret as Christ's suffering in the woman.          In her teens, she returned home to help her mother in the running of the boarding house. Gertrude allowed a priest to stay and this became such a source of scandal that Houselander and her mother suffered ostracism in the community. This may have been partly influential in her decision to leave the Roman Catholic Church as a teenager, not returning until in her twenties. It may also have contributed to a sense of isolation she would feel at times, reflected in panic attacks when entering rooms and meeting strangers, so much so that she was considered neurotic.          One night, in July 1918, Houselander was sent by her mother on an errand. On her way to the street vendor, she looked up and saw what she later described as a huge Russian icon spread across the sky. The icon she saw was Christ crucified lifted up and looking down, brooding over the world. Shortly after, she read in a newspaper an article about the assassination of Russian Tsar Nicholas II. She said the face she saw in the newspaper photograph was the face she saw spread out over the sky as the crucified Christ.          A third vision occurred when she was travelling on a busy underground train when she suddenly saw Christ, living and rejoicing, suffering and dying, in each and everyone of the passengers. When she left the train, the mystical experience continued for several days, during which she became persuaded that the unity of life in Christ was the only solution to loneliness and the human condition.          Another experience involved one of her doctors, who had died but appeared and sat next to her on a bus. They were able to talk and converse.          The three mystical experiences she claimed to have experienced convinced her that Christ is to be found in all people, even those whom the world shunned because they did not conform to certain standards of piety. She would write that if people looked for Christ in only the ""saints,"" they would not find him. She herself smoked and drank and had a sharp tongue. She returned to the Catholic Church in 1925, but her spiritual reading was founded almost entirely on the Gospels, rather than the Fathers of the Church or official Church documents. She met and fell in love with Sidney Reilly, famous spy and the model for Ian Fleming's James Bond, but he left her broken-hearted when he married another woman. She would never marry.          Houselander was a prolific writer and contributed many pieces to religious magazines, such as the ""Messenger of the Sacred Heart"" and ""The Children's Messenger"". Her first book, ""This War is the Passion"", was published in 1941 and in it she placed the suffering of the individual and its meaning within the mystical body of Christ. For a time, she became publishers Sheed & Ward's best selling writer, drawing praise from people such as Ronald Knox:""she seemed to see everything for the first time, and the driest of doctrinal considerations shone out like a restored picture when she had finished with it. And her writing was always natural; she seemed to find no difficulty in getting the right word; no, not merely the right word, the telling word, that left you gasping.""          During the Second World War, doctors began sending patients to Houselander for counselling and therapy. Even though she lacked formal education in this area, she seemed to have a natural empathy for people in mental anguish and the talent for helping them to rebuild their world. A visitor once found her alone on the floor, apparently in great pain, which she attributed to her willingness to take on herself a great trial and temptation that was overwhelming another person.          A psychiatrist, Eric Strauss, later President of the British Psychological Society, said of Houslander: ""she loved them back to life... .she was a divine eccentric.""          Houselander titled her autobiography ""A Rocking-Horse Catholic"" to differentiate herself from those termed ""cradle Catholics"". She died of breast cancer in 1954, at the age of 53.          Love is most likely to spring from another's need for us, and the fact of spending ourselves for another always generates new life in us. To give life is the purpose of love, and we love those people most of all whose needs waken a response in us that floods us with creative energy, causing us to put out new green shoots of life.          Christ is among us          His heart like a rose          expanding within us . . .          God's will for you is to serve him, in his way, as he chooses now. It is only a want of humility to think of extreme vocations, like being a nun or a nurse, while you try to by-pass your present obvious vocation . . . Today you have to use what you have today, and do not look beyond it.          We go through life with dark forces within us and around us, haunted by the ghosts of repudiated terrors and embarrassments, assailed by devils, but we are also continually guided by invisible hands; our darkness is lit by many little flames, from night-lights to the stars. Those who are afraid to look into their own hearts know nothing of the light that shines in the darkness.          Prayer alone can teach us to concentrate again, can lead us to absolute trust in God, and make our minds ready for other essential things . . . for the contemplation (not mere observation) of beauty.          It seems a law of fallen nature that life must always come to its being through darkness, and this makes us even more aware of its beauty. Dawn is lovelier because it comes after night, spring because it follows winter.          To surrender all that we are, as we are, to the spirit of love in order that our lives may bear Christ into the world – that is what we shall be asked.          The beginning of human happiness, and even of human sanity, is to begin to know           God . . . Goodness draws the human soul as a tide is drawn by light.          Lift up your eyes and see the star!          The one essential for sanctity is the capacity to love.          The one thing she [Mary] did and does is the one thing that we all have to do, namely, to bear Christ into the world.

415114,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415114,Coregonus lavaretus,"Coregonus lavaretus is a species of freshwater whitefish, in the family Salmonidae. It is the type species of its genus ""Coregonus"".          There are widely different concepts about the delimitation of the species ""Coregonus lavaretus"" and about the number of species in the genus ""Coregonus"" in general.          In a narrow sense, ""Coregonus lavaretus"", or the lavaret, is considered to be endemic          to Lake Bourget and Lake Aiguebelette in the Rhône river basin in France, whereas it formerly also occurred in Lake Geneva. According to this view there is a great number of distinct whitefish species in lakes, rivers and brackish waters of Central and Northern Europe.          In the broad sense, ""Coregonus lavaretus"", referred to as the common whitefish or European whitefish, is widespread from central and northwest Europe to Siberia. Often called the ""C. lavaretus"" complex and considered as a superspecies, it encompasses many of the whitefish populations suggested by others to be locally restricted species (such as the British powan and the gwyniad or the Alpine gravenche, as well as distinct intralacustrine morphs and populations characterized by different feeding habits, gill raker numbers, growth patterns and migration behaviour. Genetic studies suggest that the whitefish diversity within this complex is mostly of post-glacial origin. The resource polymorphism represented by the feeding morphs has evolved repeatedly and independently within individual lakes, and similar morphs in different lakes are not related to each other.          There is much variation among the European whitefish forms, but in general they have a tapered body, a slightly protruding upper jaw and a fleshy dorsal fin that is typical of the salmon family. The snout is short and tapered, a fact that distinguishes this species from the two other North European ""Coregonus"" species, vendace (""Coregonus albula"") and the introduced peled (""Coregonus peled""). The former has a protuberant lower jaw while in the latter, the jaws are equal in length. The back is bluish green or brownish, the flanks silvery and the belly white. The fins are dark grey. This fish seldom grows more than long or exceeds in weight.          The European whitefish mostly feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates or zooplankton. Larger fish also take insects off the surface of the water and eat fish fry. Breeding takes place in the autumn between September and November, largely depending on the water temperature. Different populations in the same sections of water may spawn at different times. Many populations in seas and lakes tend to make their way up-river to spawn, but others populations remain in lakes or the sea even when breeding.","['Coregonus', 'Freshwater fish of Europe', 'Animals described in 1758']"

3025019,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3025019,Terminal Railway Post Office,"Terminal railway post offices were sorting facilities which were established by the Railway Mail Service to speed the distribution of parcel post. These offices were usually located in or near railroad stations in major cities or junction points. Terminal railway post offices operated generally from 1913-1914 into the mid-1960s, before their function was absorbed by post office sectional centers.          On January 1, 1913, the United States Post Office began handling parcel post, in addition to letters and more conventional mail. This service, which was in direct competition with the privately owned express companies, was quickly embraced by the general public, and over two million packages were mailed in the first week after parcel post service began.          Terminal Railway Post Offices (Term RPO) were started in nearly 100 cities in late 1913 and 1914, primarily to help handle the increase in volume of parcel post which was overwhelming the main transportation system. These terminals also came to distribute transit parcel post, circulars, magazines, and papers - mail that was generally considered less urgent than first class letters. Letter cases were used at many terminals to take care of advance work or unworked letters from Railway Post Office (RPO) routes, while a few terminals handled parcel post almost exclusively. The largest terminal railway post office was the Penn Terminal in the G.P.O. Building in New York City, New York -- in 1951, it had over 1,100 clerks. Penn Terminal handled advance work for many of the railway post office routes leaving New York City. By comparison, the West Side Terminal, located along the New York Central line near the Hudson River piers, handled parcel post almost exclusively. Because parcel post transportation was generally by rail, most terminal RPOs were housed in or adjacent to the railroad station.          Where mails for more than one state were distributed, the ""state rights"" of the assignments were prorated. If one-fourth of the mail distributed at the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Terminal was Ohio mail, clerks with ""Ohio rights"" were entitled to one-fourth of the assignments.          The number of Terminal railway post offices peaked in 1914, with nearly 100 offices. In 1915, that number declined to 88, with a further decline to 71 offices by 1942, as many smaller offices were closed and their duties returned to RPO routes.           All the mail originating in the cities where Terminals were located was distributed by the city post offices. In many cases, this duplication of distribution was in the same building. Local postmasters had no jurisdiction over terminal RPO operations until the 1950s, when all the terminals were put under the supervision of the postmasters of the city in which they were located. The filling of assignments in the terminal was then limited to the roster from the civil service examination of the city post office.          As railway post office routes declined in number, the volume of parcel post transported by this mode also decreased, allowing the closure of smaller terminals. Development of the U.S. Postal Service sectional centers duplicated many of the functions of the terminal RPO, and the terminals were phased out by the 1960s.          First class mail worked (sorted for distribution) by terminal RPOs usually received a Terminal RPO postmark. Like the cancellations from RPO cars themselves, terminal RPO postmarks are collected by those who specialize in this aspect of postal history.          This is a preliminary list of some of the almost 100 terminal railway post office facilities which existed between 1913 and the early 1960s.","['Rail transportation in the United States', 'United States Postal Service']"

The lake is man-made, the result of sluicing operations that began in 1873 when John Ewing (1844–1922) formed the St.Bathans Channel Company, to mine the Kildare Hill Gold Claim in St Bathans. His company constructed a tailings channel and introduced hydraulic elevating to work the claim. As this work progressed the Kildare Hill Claim became the site of the deepest hydraulic elevating operation in the world, that would turn a 120-metre hill into a 68-metre hole. Work stopped in 1902 when there was insufficient fall in the tailings channel to carry away the tailings. By 1905 John Ewing was bankrupt as a result of poor investments in other locations. The Kildare Hill Claim was then taken up by the Scandinavian Water Race Company in that year. This company restarted operations and worked the claim until 1932, when it was finally abandoned due to the fear of undermining the town of St Bathans. Natural drainage from the surrounding hills filled the hole with water and created the present day lake. The Blue Lake is a key feature of modern-day St. Bathans and is used for swimming, fishing, bodyboarding, and kayaking.",['Lakes of Otago']
35307809,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35307809,Bogdan Saray,"Boğdan Sarayi (Turkish for ""Palace of Bogdania (Moldavia)"") was an Eastern Orthodox church in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul. Erected in the Byzantine era, its original dedication is unknown. In the Ottoman era the small edifice, being dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra, was known as Agios Nikólaos tou Bogdansarághi (). and was part of the Istanbul residence of the Moldavian ""hospodar""′s legation to the Ottoman Porte. The building - whose parts above ground have almost completely disappeared - is a minor example of Byzantine architecture in Constantinople.          The remains of the church lie in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood () of Salmatomruk, not far from Edirnekapı (the ancient Gate of Charisius), 250 m. east of the museum of Chora and 100 m north of the Kefeli Mosque, both former Byzantine religious buildings. The ruins of the edifice are hardly accessible, as of 2012, as they are enclosed in a tire shop at ""Draman Caddesi 32"".          The building was erected on the slope of the sixth hill of Constantinople which overlooks the Golden Horn. Nothing is known about the edifice in the Byzantine Age, but due to its position it was likely an annex of the monastery of ""St. John the Baptist in the Rock"" (, pr. ""Hagios Ioannis Prodromos en ti Petra""), one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople, where, among other relics, the instruments of the Passion of Christ were kept. Nevertheless, due to its small dimensions it is not likely that the building was the ""katholikon"" (main church) of the monastery. According to some sources it was erected in twelfth century, during the Komnenian age, while for others it is a Palaiologan foundation of the fourteenth century. Its north-south orientation shows that it was originally erected not as a church, but rather as a funerary chapel.          After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, in sixteenth century the chapel became part of the large land estate bought by the ""hospodar"" of Moldavia to host his envoys in Istanbul, and named accordingly ""Boğdan Sarayi"" (""Moldavian Palace""). In this respect, its usage as private chapel of a patrician house represents a rarity in the Ottoman city. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the complex - a coveted property because the high border wall protected it by fires - was leased by the Sultan as residence for several foreign envoys, among them the Swedish ambassadors to the Ottoman Porte P. Strasburg and C. Rolomb, who sojourned in Istanbul in 1634 and 1657/58 respectively. In June 1760 the Phanariote John Callimaches endowed it to the Russian monastery of St. Pantaleon on Mount Athos. The complex burned down in the fire of 1784, and afterward the land was only used as a market garden. The possession of the church by the Athos monastery was confirmed again by relatives of Callimaches in January 1795 and August 1814, but the Russian monks showed little interest in the church's restoration, possibly because of the state of war between the Russian Empire and the Sublime Porte. In the nineteenth century the edifice steadily decayed and after the 1894 Istanbul earthquake fell into ruin. In 1918 a German archaeologist pursued clandestine excavations and found in the crypt three unnamed tombs. In the second half of the 20th century the remains of the building were enclosed in a shanty (), and today—lying inside a tire shop—they are hardly accessible. As of 2012 the parts above ground have almost disappeared, and only the crypt still exists.          The edifice had a rectangular plan, with sides of 6.20 m and 3.50 m, and was originally composed of two storeys, consisting of an above ground chapel and a subterranean crypt. The chapel was surmounted by a dome with pendentives insisting on two transverse arches across the walls, and ended towards North with a Bema and a polygonal apse adorned externally with niches, while the crypt was surmounted by a barrel vault and had also a simple apse. The edifice's brickwork consisted of courses of three or four rows of white stones alternating with a row of red bricks, obtaining a chromatic effect typical of the late Byzantine period. Its north-south orientation suggests the building's use as a funerary chapel, rather than as a church, since churches in Constantinople were almost always oriented in east-west direction. The attested past existence of remains of walls perpendicular to the structure indicates the possibility that this was part of a larger complex, most likely the monastery of St. John of Petra, one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople.","['14th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings', 'Fatih', 'Byzantine sacred architecture', 'Byzantine art', 'History of Moldavia (1504\xe2\x80\x931711)']"

Wealthy or royal families hosted feasts for the purpose of gaining loyalty and a strong image that would help them politically or socially in the future. People of every social status hosted feasts as a celebration of family and life.          There were two main types of feasts, as discussed by Lisa J. LeCount and suggested by Dietler, diacritical exclusionary events and inclusionary events. Diacritical feasts were hosted by the wealthy and powerful, with only a strict list of other elite guests. These feasts were to demonstrate differences in social status and ensure that other members of society knew who had the power. This is evident with royals, politicians and the elite gaining loyalty through hosting feasts or performing rituals. Inclusionary feasts were held to promote solidarity and equality among the entire community. The invitation list for these feasts was broader and the event was larger and in a public setting. Inclusionary feasts were celebrations by the community as a whole. The cuisine for inclusionary feasts was similar to that of daily meals, whereas for diacritical feasts the cuisine was higher end and meant to impress the guests. Feasts differed slightly throughout eras and various societies in Mesoamerica.          Feasts in Maya society were composed of three parts: 1) worshiping of an ancestor by presenting offerings, 2) the sacrificing of the offerings, and 3) the consumption of foods that were blessed by the gods. The Maya hosted feasts for various reasons such as to celebrate marriages, deaths, health, various life events, farming celebrations, and holidays. Studies of the Late Classic Maya demonstrate a connection between feasting and politics. Maya feasting seems to have been very competitive among elites and royals who were trying to gain political loyalty by hosting the most extravagant feast with lavish foods and items. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric data shows that Late Classic Maya feasts were segmented into two corresponding parts: a private religious part and then a public festival. The private religious section was focused on gods, family, and ancestor worship while the public festival was often political or social. Rain ceremonies are an example of the segmented feasts that the Maya hosted.          Public feasting in Late Classic Maya society included the community as a whole, but still celebrated the elites and royals. Sixteenth Century Yucatec Maya display evidence of public feasting for two occasions. They celebrated marriages or ancestors with feasts, but also hosted a feast simply for building and maintaining relationships, which required all guests of the feast to then host their own feast in the near future. Feasts of the Yucatec seemed to have occurred on every social level and all heads of the families had to host feasts at times of rites of passages for their family members in order to maintain the social honor and status of their family. The men plan the feast while the women prepare foods with their other female family members. Each family makes lots of food to create a giant festival for the community which often include markets, bullfights, fireworks, dancing, and obviously drinking and eating.          Rain ceremonies are an example of the feasts that the Modern Yucatec Maya host and they demonstrate both the religious and the public parts of feasts. The ceremony takes three days to complete all the ritual activities, with the first two days being confined to only a small number of the community members. On the last day of the ritual the public is involved. On the first day, members of the community who ritual specialists construct an altar near the plaza where the ceremony will take place. On day two sacred food is offered to the gods at dawn, noon, three, seven and twice more sometime before two in the morning. Once those sacrifices are over, the people who participated in the ritual eat the sacrificed foods. After all of the very religious activities take place, the public festival is held and is meant to be a time for friends, family and eating.          Food was a very important and central aspect of many royal events and activities. For palace sponsored feasts, cooks prepared all of the food while noblewomen supervised the kitchen staff. The Mayas had a strong belief in animatism and LeCount thinks that they may have believed that when Mayan cooks prepared the feasts with maize and ka’kaw, that they were animated by the supernatural. Elite cooking differed from commoners’ cooking because of the skills and knowledge that the cooks had which allowed the meals to become sacred or symbolic.          At Xunantunich, Belize, archeological evidence of food serving vessels shows a distinction between vessels used at private and public feasts. Different serving platters were found that suggest certain vessels were used to serve sacred feasting foods and others were used for daily or more public events. Elite members indulged with polychrome plates and vases and had a higher frequency of serving bowls and platters. Common household ruins show less evidence of serving bowls and vases and LeCount suggests that they may have used small gourds to offer foods to the gods.          Tamales were a main dish of daily meals as well as a common ritual food in the central Maya lowlands. Deer, turkey, dog and other meats were saved for public festivals. Sacred foods and festival foods were different to symbolize the difference between community and an individual. Foods at feasts were presented as a sacred item and sacrificed to the gods. Maize is thought to evoke rain functions of the gods and to symbolize purity and divinity which made it a good sacrificial food for the gods. Maize was also a typical festival food along with tamales, tortillas, chicken, pig, chocolate and rum. The Yucatec Maya served chocolate at their weddings and baptisms. Cacao is not served at religious events, but is often at political or social gatherings. Cacao seeds are important because they are used in the negotiation of marriages. At public ceremonies freshwater snails, jutes, were eaten. The elites tended to eat ritual foods such as tamales and chocolate more often than commoners. Modern Day Mayan officials or elite consume chocolate drinks in private rituals to form social and political relationships.          Feasting occurred on a wide variety of social scales and contexts in Aztec society. They were held as celebrations of births, deaths, marriages or other events. The feasts included activities such as gift exchanges, human sacrifices, incense burning, speeches, plays, and of course eating and drinking. Royal and noble houses entertained and hosted feasts at scheduled times such as to distribute foods and money to the kingdom’s staff and administrative workers. Both kingdoms and common households held feasts to celebrate religious events and life events of their family (Smith 2003).           Aztec Codices show depictions of public-religious feasts, elite feasts hosted by the ruler, and home celebrations. Most feasts included some type of ritual activity, but there were some feasts that were more religious and ritual than others. At these ritual feasts the foods are not just offered to the gods, but are consumed at a particular time throughout the ceremony. When worshiping death gods, such as Mictlantecuhtli, human flesh is consumed around the temple of the ritual.          Feasts were a large part of political interaction of the elite because they served as a way to gain loyal allies that would back them in political competitions. The dishes and vessels that the food was served in showed the status of the elite and was very important to the power and competition of the host. Feasts held by royalty or nobles included high quality foods to emphasis their social status.          Aztec rulers hosted feasts and dances in order to bring young warriors together or to celebrate the success of a warrior. The feasts made the warriors’ job look appealing and rewarding. Only rulers of capitals that received tributes could directly reward the warriors with feasts and events, whereas rulers of those communities who had to pay tribute did not have the resources to spend on the warriors.          Pulque, a fermented drink that is made from sap of the maguey plant was consumed often at Aztec rituals and feasts, but usually only at night. Codices also picture alcoholic drinks, tortillas, tamales and cacao. Meat stews, tamales, and maize, which was believed to be a link between the sun and people and to carry the sun’s energy, were all consumed at feasts.          Food could have been served in either ceramic or stone vessels or gourds and baskets. Pulque was served in vessels that were decorated with symbols, such as half suns, skulls and cross bones, which represented night, disorder, and destruction. There were some specific pulque vessels that were only used during ceremonies or rituals, such as the “stone rabbit vessel”. The rabbit vessel symbolized the relationship of the moon, rabbits, and pulque and was only used during celebrations of Ometochtli (“Two Rabbit”) which was an important day of the 260-day calendar.","['Mesoamerican society', 'Mesoamerican diet and subsistence']"

By 1880 cricket was well established in St. Petersburg, with British diplomats and merchants challenging the British managers and foremen of the textile mills in an annual match. By 1895 there were four cricket clubs in St. Petersburg.          The Communist Revolution of 1917 put paid to the spread of cricket in Russia as it was seen as a game of the ""bourgeois"" and playing it was discouraged. With the British moving out of St. Petersburg following the Revolution, the game quickly died with them.          Cricket Russia was founded in 2004 by Ashwani Chopra and Mohanjeet Singh Arora with the help of cricket lovers like Vineet Arora, Manish Rana, Samar Shakeel and many others.

29900143,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29900143,Gustav Adolf Jebsen,"Gustav Adolf Jebsen (30 January 1884 – 20 January 1951) was a Norwegian industrialist.          He was born in Bergen as the youngest son of factory owner and ship-owner Peter Jebsen (1824–1892) and Sophie Catharina Sundt (1849–1912). He was a brother of Kristian Gerhard Sundt Jebsen and maternal grandson of Christian Gerhard Ameln Sundt. In 1917 he married attorney's daughter Lilla Døscher. He was a granduncle of Kristian Gerhard Jebsen and Atle Jebsen, and an uncle of Kristian Jebsen.          Jebsen finished education in machine engineering at Bergen technical school at the age of seventeen, and studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule Hannover and the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg. He took the doctorate in Zurich in 1905 with the thesis ""Zur Kenntnis der Phenoxymucobrom- und Chlorsäure als aromatische Verbindungen"". From 1905 to 1906 he studied at Sorbonne.          In 1906 he was hired in Sam Eyde's company Elektrokemisk. Together with Peder Farup he discovered and innovated the use of titanium dioxide as the pigment titanium white; together with the exploitation of the Søderberg electrode, this was the most important innovation during Jebsen's time.          The process of producing titanium white was figured out in 1914. Before that, Jebsen had become chief executive officer of Elektrokemisk in 1912. In 1916 he became chairman of the new company Titan Co. which produced titanium dioxide. In 1919 he briefly served as the first president of the Federation of Norwegian Industries. During the post-World War I economic crisis he had to leave Elektrokemisk in 1920, but became chief executive officer of Titan Co. in 1924. The shares in Titan Co. plummeted until being bought in 1927 by the American corporation National Lead along with the patent rights for titanium white. Jebsen was hired in National Lead, and worked out of Paris, from 1929 as chief executive of Titan Co. Inc in Europe. The corporation included companies such as Titangesellschaft in Germany and British Titan Products.          In 1940 Jebsen moved from Paris to New York City. In 1943 Nygaardsvold's Cabinet, exiled from Norway because of the war, named industrial committees consisting of expatriates in London and New York, and Jebsen worked for the New York-based committee. For his work here he was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav after the war, in 1946. He died in January 1951 in London.","['1884 births', '1951 deaths', 'People from Bergen', 'Norwegian chemical engineers', 'Norwegian businesspeople', 'Norwegian expatriates in Germany', 'Norwegian expatriates in Switzerland', 'Norwegian expatriates in France', 'Norwegian expatriates in the United States', 'Norwegian people of World War II']"

It was previously known as the 5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse, which was a regular cavalry regiment of the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1921 by the amalgamation of the 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) and the 12th Cavalry.          The 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) was raised on 1 August 1857 by Captain Frederick Wale during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and served at Lucknow. Captain Wale was killed in action on 1 March 1858, while leading the regiment in the pursuit of rebels, and was replaced by Major Dighton Probyn, VC. In 1860 the regiment was dispatched to China to take part in the Second Opium War. It participated in the advance on Peking and returned to India in 1861 with a good reputation. The regiment saw service in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80 and then took part in the Black Mountains Expedition; it went to Chitral and formed part of the Malakand Field Force. During the First World War, the regiment served in Mesopotamia.          The 12th Cavalry was also raised during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, by Captain PR Hockin in October 1857. The cavalry committed a war crime by massacring ""hundreds"" people at Mahua Dabar in 1857. It formed part of the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and served in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80. During the First World War, the regiment fought in the Mesopotamian Campaign.          After the First World War, the number of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming the entire cavalry line. The 11th King Edward’s Own Lancers (Probyn’s Horse) and the 12th Cavalry were amalgamated at Meerut on 28 August 1921 to form 5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse. The uniform of Probyn's Horse was blue with scarlet facings. The new regiment's badge consisted of the Prince of Wales's plumes. Its class composition was one squadron each of Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. The regiment was mechanised in 1940. During the Second World War, the regiment served with great distinction in Burma. On the Partition of India in 1947, Probyn's Horse was allotted to Pakistan. In 1956, Pakistan became a republic and all titles pertaining to British royalty were dropped. The regiment's new designation was 5 Horse, although informally, it continues to be known as the Probyn's Horse.

He remained in the Royal Air Force until 1937, and returned to service during World War II in administrative roles.          John Leacroft born on 4 November 1888, the son of Dr John William Leacroft. He was educated at Aldenham School before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. He first joined the British Armed Forces when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant for service with the senior division of the University of Cambridge Officers' Training Corps on 3 February 1909, but he resigned this commission on 1 November the same year.          Leacroft joined the Army Service Corps with the outbreak of war in 1914, and served with them in France and Egypt. He had been promoted to captain by the time he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915.          Leacroft was originally posted as an observer with No. 14 Squadron RAF in Egypt in 1916. He saw action during the Senussi Uprising and the second Turkish attack on the Suez Canal as part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. After receiving pilot training he was appointed a Flying Officer on 20 March 1917, and posted to No. 19 Squadron RAF to fly Spad VIIs in May 1917, just as low-level ground attack sorties were being introduced in the lead up to the Battle of Messines. He scored his first victory on 17 June 1917. He tallied one each in July and August, and a double on 1 September to become an ace. By the end of the month he was a double ace. He had been appointed a Flight Commander on 22 July 1917. After four more triumphs in October, he was withdrawn from the front. Two of his October victories came in support of Allied troops during the Third Battle of Ypres, when on other occasions he carried a box of 25 lb bombs in his cockpit, as the Spad had no bomb racks. For these missions, he was awarded the Military Cross on 27 October 1918, the citation, published the following March, read:          When he returned for another tour of duty in early 1918, 19 Squadron had become the first unit to be equipped with the new Sopwith Dolphin. The squadron returned to operations on 13 February 1918. There followed a period of teething problems with the new aircraft. To add to these difficulties, the Dolphins were attacked by fellow British pilots because the unfamiliar Dolphin was assumed to be German.          Leacroft drove down two Albatros D.Vs on 15 March 1918 with his new aircraft. Then the Allied forces were faced with the German Spring Offensive. He followed his earlier March victories by burning a Pfalz D.III out of the air on 23 March; the following day saw another double victory by Leacroft. On 27 March he carried out a desperate ground attack mission against German troops using a road near Albert, Somme, this was quoted in the official British history, ""The War in the Air"" as an example of the tactics used to stop the offensive, and earned him a Bar to his MC, awarded on 22 June 1918. The citation read:          Victories on 12 April and 2 May rounded out his list of wins. He had survived being shot down twice. In turn, he had destroyed ten enemy aircraft; two of those wins had been shared with other pilots. Leacroft had also driven down out of control a dozen opponents. He ranked second out of the 20 aces in his squadron. Many of his initial combats had come against members of Richthofen's Flying Circus. His Squadron Commander in 1918, E. R. ""Toby"" Pretyman, described him as ""an outstanding pilot and the best flight commander on the Western Front in his time"". He was presented with both his MC and Bar by King George V in an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 September 1918.          Leacroft had been granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918, and he continued his career after the war, taking the new RAF rank of flight lieutenant. His first post-war duty was as a flying instructor at the new RAF College Cranwell from 1920 to 1922, he was then posted to RAF Iraq Command where he would stay until 1924. On 1 January 1924, he was promoted to squadron leader. Later in 1924 he took command of No. 17 Squadron at RAF Hawkinge. He commanded the squadron until 1928 when he was posted as chief flying instructor with No. 3 Flying Training School at RAF Grantham. After two years there he was posted to RAF Halton in 1930, and after promotion to wing commander on 1 January 1932, took charge of administration at No. 1 School of Technical Training there in February 1933, commanding No. 1 Apprentice Wing.          On 15 June 1937 it was announced that he would be the next station commander at RAF Thornaby, and on 2 July 1937, he was promoted to group captain. Thornaby had previously housed No. 9 Flying Training School, but now took in reconnaissance squadrons of No. 16 Group, RAF Coastal Command. Leacroft served until his retirement on 1 December 1937.          He was still in the Reserve of Air Force Officers on 12 June 1939, when he was recalled to duty as a squadron leader. He returned to the active list as a wing commander on 1 September 1939. In 1942 he was appointed president of the Air Crew Selection Board, then based at Cardington, Bedfordshire. He retired again on 19 April 1945. In retirement, he settled in Bexhill-on-Sea where he died on 26 August 1971.          Leacroft married Gladys, daughter of George Underhill Cuddon in 1926. Gladys lived until 22 March 1977, when she died in Clifton, Bristol, a requiem mass was held at Clifton Cathedral on 29 March. They were survived by their only daughter, Diana.          Leacroft was a noted sportsman in his younger days. Before World War I, he hunted regularly with the Belvoir Hunt (among others). Between the wars, he represented the RAF at cricket, polo and shooting—competing at Bisley.","['British World War I flying aces', '1888 births', '1971 deaths', 'Royal Air Force officers', 'Royal Army Service Corps officers', 'Royal Air Force personnel of World War II', 'Royal Flying Corps officers', 'Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge', 'People from Derby', 'Recipients of the Military Cross']"

He was a prominent literary figure in the Arabic-speaking world during the 20th century. Some of Halasa’s most influential novels include ""al-Dhahik"" (Laughter), ""al-Su’al"" (The Question), and ""Sultana"".          He was also a long-time member of the Communist Party, no matter what country he was living in. Halasa’s views awarded him a life of exile, spending many years in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. He died in Damascus at the relatively young age of 57, after which his body was returned to Jordan, where he had not been for 34 years (he left Jordan in 1955).          As someone with great command of literary technique and theory, on top of his exceptionally fluid style, Halasa’s writings combine smooth reading with complex structuring. This was because he had the ability to draw on diverse narrative techniques and literary tradition. According to comparative literature professor Walid Hamarneh, Halasa wanted to ""[utilize] modern and post-modern techniques in novel writing, while at the same time preserving the great insights and creative achievements of the nineteenth-century realists.""           Ghalib Halasa was born in 1932, in a mostly Christian village called Ma'in, within the Madaba governorate of Jordan. No one knows for sure on which day he was born, but most agree that he was either born on the 3rd or the 18th of December. Fairly early in life, Halasa began reading books in Arabic, French, and English, while also demonstrating strong writing skills at the Christian Mutran boarding school for boys. Specifically, Halasa read a great deal about Marxism, politics, and American literature. This interest in American literature manifests later in Halasa's life when he translates into Arabic a biography about William Faulkner, and J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye.          Following high school, Halasa attended the American University of Beirut, where he received his B.A. in Journalism. For two years, while at the university, Halasa split his time between studying at the American University of Beirut and teaching at a school in Amman, Jordan. While in college, Halasa also became a member of the Communist Party. This resulted in jail-time, including almost two years in a Baghdad prison.          Forbidden from living in Jordan, Halasa headed to Egypt in 1955. He studied at the American University in Cairo, where he also taught, and began writing articles on various literary topics. Later, Halasa began translating for both the Chinese Embassy and the German Press Agency. Throughout this time, Halasa remained interested and engaged in socialist ideologies and politics. After attending protests against Anwar Sadat, Halasa saw time in prison once more, and eventually banishment from Egypt in 1976. After exile from Egypt, he spent time in numerous countries: Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Germany, and lastly Syria, where he died.          In 1982, Halasa fought alongside the Palestinians in the Lebanon War.          Halasa authored two collections of short stories, seven novels, four books of literary criticism, and three other books of various natures. He also translated several books from English. Unfortunately, much of his work remains untranslated.","['Arabic literature', 'Jordanian writers', 'Literary critics of Arabic', '1932 births', '1989 deaths']"

This temporary station was named Godley Toll Bar and closed on 11 December 1842 when the line was extended to Broadbottom.          Godley East once had four platforms, two on the Manchester–Glossop Line and two linking the Woodhead Line with the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) route to Apethorne Junction (Woodley). The branch opened in 1866, after which Godley became known as Godley Junction. The CLC platforms were only ever lightly used. The station and sidings were controlled by a single mechanical signal box which was located at the east end of the 'up' (Hadfield) platform.          The electrification of the Woodhead line in 1954 gave Godley a strategic importance that it retained until the through route to Sheffield closed in 1981. Godley was one of the locations where trains to and from the Liverpool district changed from diesel or steam to electric traction, and vice versa. In steam days there was a large turntable situated on the CLC branch. The turntable pit is still in existence and remains in remarkably good condition and free of debris.          The station was renamed from ""Godley Junction"" to ""Godley"" on 6 May 1974.          On 7 July 1986, a new station called Godley was opened on the site of the original Godley Toll Bar station, and the original station was renamed Godley East. With the addition of Hattersley serving more closely the nearby council estate, train services were gradually reduced and the station formally closed on 27 May 1995.           The main platforms remain intact, although now largely overgrown. The platforms on the Hadfield line are fenced off; however, from the now cycle track which runs along the former line linking to Stockport, the remains of the other platforms are visible. The derelict footbridge was removed during the late 2000s.","['Disused railway stations in Tameside', 'Former Great Central Railway stations', 'Former Cheshire Lines Committee stations', 'Railway stations opened in 1841', 'Railway stations closed in 1995']"

Her husband was Emperor Taiwu.          She was a daughter of the Xia's founding emperor Helian Bobo (Emperor Wulie). In 428, during the reign of her brother Helian Chang, Emperor Taiwu led his Northern Wei forces to capture the Xia capital Tongwan (統萬, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), and while Helian Chang fled, she was captured along with most nobles and officials of Xia. She and her two sisters were all taken as Emperor Taiwu's imperial consorts. In 432, she was created empress, presumably after being able to pass the traditional Tuoba tribe test by being able to forge a gold statue.          Little is known about Empress Helian's life during her husband's reign. She did not bear him any sons. In 452, he was assassinated by his eunuch Zong Ai, who claimed that, by her orders, Emperor Taiwu's son Tuoba Yu the Prince of Nan'an should be made emperor, bypassing Emperor Taiwu's apparent intended heir, Tuoba Jun, the son of Tuoba Huang the Crown Prince, who had died in 451. Tuoba Yu honored her as empress dowager, but there is no particular evidence to suggest that Empress Helian was actually involved in Zong's conspiracy. Later in 452, Zong assassinated Tuoba Yu as well, but the officials then overthrew Zong and put Tuoba Jun on the throne as Emperor Wencheng, and he honored her as grand empress dowager.

457922,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457922,Pachuco,"Pachuco refers to a particular old school subculture of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans associated with zoot suits, street gangs, nightlife, and flamboyant public behavior. The idea of the pachuco – a zoot-suited, well-dressed, street-connected flamboyant playboy of Hispanic/Latino heritage – originated in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, had moved north, following the line of migration of Mexican railroad workers (""traqueros"") into Los Angeles, where it developed further.          A pachuca is the female counterpart, often idealized as a beautiful Chicana woman in extravagant evening dress or a female version of the zoot suit, out with a pachuco boyfriend for a night on the town. Pachucas broke taboos of their time by wearing men's-style pants sometimes and appearing in public often with their pachuco boyfriends; at the time, a ""good woman"" was considered to have her place in the home. They defied male/female stereotypes and roles in Mexican-American culture in much the same way flappers had in European-American culture in the 1920s.          The origin of the term ""pachuco"" is uncertain, but one theory connects it to the city of El Paso, Texas, which was sometimes referred to as ""Chuco Town"" or ""El Chuco."" People migrating to El Paso would say, in Spanish, that they were going ""pa' El Chuco."" These migrants became known as pachucos.          The name ""Pachuco"" is quite possibly derived from the name of the city of Pachuca, the capital of Mexico's Hidalgo state. There have long been migrants from Hidalgo state living in Texas.          Another theory says that the word derives from ""pocho"", a derogatory term for a Mexican born in the United States who has lost touch with the Mexican culture. The word is also said to mean ""punk"" or ""troublemaker"". Yet another theory is put forth by author Laura L. Cummings who postulates a possible indigenous origin of the term. The founder of the ""Pachuco"" subculture was a Mexican comedian and film actor named German Valdés better-known by his Artistic name ""Tin-Tan"". He introduced the Pachuco dress and slang throughout his Golden age-era films.          Connections have also been found between ""Pachucos"" and mixed civilians who lived near the Mexican-American border during the turn of the century, and between ""Pachucos"" and the poor soldiers who fought in the Mexican Revolution in the armies of Pancho Villa.          Pachucos called their slang Caló (sometimes called ""pachuquismo""), a unique argot that drew on the original Spanish Gypsy Caló, Mexican Spanish, the New Mexican dialect of Spanish, and American English, employing words and phrases creatively applied. To a large extent, Caló went mainstream and is one of the last surviving vestige of the Pachuco, often used in the lexicon of some urban Latinos in the United States to this day. The influence of Valdés is responsible for the assimilation of several Caló terms into Mexican slang.          The Mexican Nobel laureate Octavio Paz writes in the essay, ""The ""Pachuco"" and Other Extremes"" that the Pachuco phenomenon paralleled the zazou subculture in World War II-era Paris in style of clothing, music favored (jazz, swing, and jump blues), and attitudes. Although there was no known link between the two subcultures, they both are most certainly derivative localized blends of American pop culture in the United States.          Pachuco culture in America was at its height during World War II. The Wartime Productions Board in 1942 thought it necessary to cut back on fabric consumption, so they enacted regulations on the amount of fabric used for suits. This enactment targeted Pachucos in particular because of the excess fabric used in their zoot suits. Pachucos boldly chose not to follow these regulations, demonstrating rebellious attitudes and pride in their culture. Pachucos continued to flaunt zoot suits, now attained through bootleg tailors. As a result, these flashy zoot suits were seen as unpatriotic by other Americans. This controversial series of events helped shape Pachuco culture, and zoot suits became a symbol of cultural pride among Mexican-Americans. It didn't all end well, however, as this also led to rising tension between Pachucos and other Americans, playing a part in the start of the 1944 Zoot Suit Riots.          The pachuco subculture declined in the 1960s, evolving into the Chicano style. This style preserved some of the pachuco slang while adding a strong political element characteristic of the late 1960s American life.          In the early 1970s, a recession and the increasingly violent nature of gang life resulted in an abandonment of anything that suggested dandyism. Accordingly, Mexican-American gangs adopted a uniform of T-shirts and khakis derived from prison uniforms, and the pachuco style died out. However, the zoot suit remains a popular choice of formal wear for urban and rural Latino youths in heavily ethnic neighborhoods. It is typically worn at a prom, or in some cases, at informal Latino university commencement ceremonies.          The "" is used in Costa Rica to define Costa Rican slang. It nevertheless differs from the Mexican slang.          In Costa Rica the term ""pachuco"" refers to someone who has common habits and who is often very rude. In Costa Rica the word pachuco refers to a person who has manners that are socially unacceptable and often uses shocking language when speaking. Pachuco is also a pejorative name given to certain colloquial words and expressions. Some consider pachuco and its pachuquísmos to be Costa Rica's second language.          Pachuco style was a dominating trend among Mexican-American youth in the 1930s-40s. Pachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions. Pachucos dressed in recognizable Zoot suits, and often styled their hair into ducktails. Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look. The unique speech of pachucos was a very important element of their defined style. Consisting of creative phrases and some English words, Caló (Chicano) was a very popular form of speech among pachucos. Pachucos were seen as gangsters in the eyes of other Americans, because of the activities they participated in. They often carried concealed weapons and involved in criminal activities such as vandalism and gang related misdemeanor.          The ""Pachuca"", the female counterpart of the Pachuco, had an aesthetic sensibility as strong as the male zoot suiter. The Pachuca's hairstyle tended to be a high ""coif"" or bouffant, with the hair put up in some way (a more pronounced version of the typical hair style of the time), sometimes using hair grease. Her makeup was heavy, particularly the lipstick. The preferred colors of clothing were black and gray. One very loud version of the Pachuca look entailed wearing the masculine zoot suit, albeit with modifications to fit the female form. This was very subversive at the time because of long-held gender roles that dictated how a person should dress. Sometimes, she donned the standard heavy gold pocket chain. Another variation involved a sweater or coat - often a variant on the male zoot-suit finger-tip jacket - over knee-length skirts, plus fishnet stockings or bobby socks and platform shoes. Extravagant dresses were and are also common among pachucas. Like the entire culture, the fashion aesthetic revolved around the concept of ""see and be seen"".          This style was associated with gang membership and activity. The idea of gang membership and gang activity came from the Zoot Suit Riots that took place in Southern California. The negative image of the male zoot suiter as a ""violent gangster"" naturally extended to the Pachuca as well. The promiscuous image came from the Pachuca's high public visibility and patronage of nightlife with pachucos. The Pachuca style contrasted with the traditional Latino-American image of femininity at the time which held that the ""good"" minority woman stayed in the home.          The Pachuca's challenge to the dominant perception of femininity came during the period between the advent of women's suffrage in 1920 and the upsurge in feminist activism of the 1960s and 1970s.","['Chicano', 'History of subcultures', 'Youth culture']"

1085255,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1085255,Jetex,"The Jetex motor is a type of solid-fuel rocket motor produced for use as a powerplant for model aircraft. Originally developed in 1947, by Wilmot, Mansour & Company Ltd of Southampton, it was first demonstrated to the modelling press in early 1948, and was available to the public in June 1948, when ""Aeromodeller"" featured Jetex power on its front cover. The first motors were the Jetex 100 and 200, with the more powerful Jetex 350 following in November 1948. The most popular motor, the Jetex 50, was introduced in May 1949, along with kits for a model plane and model car using Jetex power.          Jetex motors are powered by a solid pellet of guanidine nitrate, which burns to release a variety of gases in copious volume, leaving no solid residue or ash. Thrust developed is fairly modest, suitable for horizontally launched flying models rather than vertically launched rockets. The exhaust gas is not excessively hot, which confers a safety advantage. Fuel and wick to ignite the pellets was manufactured by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). The engine casing was made of an aluminium alloy and was reusable, new fuel pellets and ignition wick being a consumable that could be bought and used in the engine.          Jetex power made a big impact in the late forties and early fifties, allowing new sorts of models, scale and duration, to be designed. Its popularity waned after the mid-fifties, and by the late 1970s was largely forgotten. Recently, there has been a reawakening of interest in Jetex; in the mid-1990s, a similar device called the Rapier was launched, and many old plans for Jetex powered models were dusted off and built with the new motors.          Compared with modern Estes-type rockets, the Jetex is quite different. It has a much gentler, cooler exhaust, so flight characteristics tend to feature gradual acceleration rather than firework-like performance. The cooler exhaust is easier to handle and does not require extensive flameproofing of the airframe. However, the fuel is more toxic and requires special handling to keep it dry and in working condition (the fuel is slightly deliquescent and will gradually absorb moisture from the atmosphere which quickly renders it inactive). As a result, Jetex were quite unreliable, often failing to ignite.","['Model rocketry', 'Rocket engines']"

In 1920, the year he completed his `Seated Nude', he exhibited alongside such major figures of modern art as Matisse and Braque, while from 1921 on he also exhibited alongside Juan Gris, Dufy, Chagall and Picasso.          By the early 1920s Galanis was famous in France and preparing for shows in Brussels, London, and New York. In 1920-21 he frequently exhibited in Paris and in 1922 his first one-man exhibition received the enthususiastic critical response that established his reputation. 'Seated Nude' was among the pictures exhibited, and in an introduction to the exhibition André Malraux described the artist's work as ""having the power to stir emotions equivalent to that of Giotto.""          This show established Galanis’ reputation as a painter and confirmed the favourable opinions already expressed on the quality of his work. Critics of his time paid much more attention to his figurative work than his landscapes, confirming the well-established view that Galanis’ first and foremost concern was his love for the human form.          Galanis received greater critical acclaim abroad in his lifetime than any other Greek modern artist of the early 20th century. The French state honoured him with the highest distinctions: full professor at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris and a lifelong member of the Académie française.          Having moved to Paris in 1900, living close to Montmartre for fifty years in a house which is now musée de Montmartre, Galanis developed his artistic talent beyond painting. He was also known for his illustrative wood engravings in books, such as the Limited Editions Club of Sophocles' ""Oedipus the King"" and the Cresset Press edition of John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"". The Limited Editions Club published 1500 signed copies in 1955 and the sister organization, Heritage Press, then reprinted unsigned volumes.          The most significant collection of Galanis' work can be found at the Teloglion Foundation at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, though examples can also be found in London's Tate Gallery.

It was forked from the FreeBSD ports collection in 1997 as the primary package management system for NetBSD. Since then it has evolved independently: in 1999, support for Solaris was added, later followed by support for other operating systems. DragonFly BSD, from release 1.4 to 3.4, used pkgsrc as its official packaging system. MINIX 3 and the Dracolinux distribution both include pkgsrc in their main releases.          There are multiple ways to install programs using pkgsrc. The pkgsrc bootstrap contains a traditional ports collection that utilizes a series of makefiles to compile software from source. Another method is to install pre-built binary packages via the pkg_add and pkg_delete tools. A high-level utility named ""pkgin"" also exists, and is designed to automate the installation, removal, and update of binary packages in a manner similar to APT or yum.          pkgsrc currently contains over 17000 packages (over 20000 including work-in-progress packages maintained outside the official tree) and includes most popular open source software.

22097588,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22097588,"Philippine presidential election, 2010","The Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections of 2010 were held on Monday, May 10, 2010. The ruling President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, was barred from seeking re-election by the 1987 Constitution, thus necessitating an election to select the 15th President.          Incumbent Vice-President Noli de Castro was allowed to seek re-election though he could have possibly sought the presidency. As he didn't offer himself in any manner of candidacy at the election, his successor was determined as the 15th Vice President of the Philippines. Although most presidential candidates have running mates, the president and vice president are elected separately, and the winning candidates may be of different political parties.          This election was also the first time that the Commission of Elections (COMELEC) implemented full automation of elections, pursuant to Republic Act 9369, ""An act authorizing the Commission on Elections to use an Automated Election System in the May 11, 1998 National or Local Elections and in subsequent National And Local Electoral Exercises"".          The results of the congressional canvassing showed that Senator Benigno Aquino III of the Liberal Party won by a plurality, although he had won with the highest percentage of votes since 1986, but not enough to have the largest margin of victory, even in elections held after 1986.          Meanwhile, in the election for the vice-presidency, Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) defeated Senator Mar Roxas of the Liberal Party in the second-narrowest margin in the history of vice presidential elections. Aquino and Binay were proclaimed in a joint session of Congress on June 9, and took their oaths on June 30, 2010. Roxas filed an electoral protest to the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET; the Supreme Court) on July 10, 2010.           The election is held every six years after 1992, on the second Monday of May. The incumbent president is term limited. The incumbent vice president may run for two consecutive terms. As Joseph Estrada, who was elected in 1998, was able to run in 2010, it is undetermined if the term limit is for life, or is only limited to the incumbent.          The plurality voting system is used to determine the winner: the candidate with the highest number of votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the presidency. The vice presidential election is a separate election, is held on the same rules, and voters may split their ticket. Both winners will serve six-year terms commencing on the noon of June 30, 2016 and ending on the same day six years later.          The candidates are determined via political conventions of the different political parties. As most political parties in the Philippines are loosely structured, with most politicians switching parties from time to time, a person not nominated by a party may either run as an independent, get drafted by another party, or form their own party. The candidacy process is supervised by the Commission on Elections (usually referred by its abbreviation ""COMELEC"") which also regulates and holds the elections. It is not uncommon for the Commission to disqualify certain candidates as ""nuisance candidates"" or those candidates who have no capacity to mount a nationwide campaign. This usually limits the candidates to a small number. The campaign will run for three months, beginning in early February 2010 and ending on the eve of the election, the Vote Counting Machines will be tested and be booted up at 5 AM in the morning and the shading of candidates will be on 7:30 in the morning CNN Philippines source says.          The counting of votes is initially held in the individual voting precincts, which are all then tabulated for the different municipalities and cities, then to the provinces, and finally to Congress, which is the final canvasser of the votes. Election protests are handled by the Supreme Court, when it sits as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal.          The COMELEC-mandated election period for this election was from January 10 to June 9, 2010.          In the Philippines, the multi-party system is implemented. Sometimes a coalition of different parties are made notably this year are the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino and PDP-LABAN, and Nacionalista Party and NPC. Each party hosts candidates who go through a nomination process to determine the presidential nominee for that party.          The list below is listed in the alphabetical order of the party:          The Philippines has two primary opinion polling companies: Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia. The following are the last released surveys prior to the election by SWS and Pulse Asia:          SWS conducted an exit poll. SWS's 2004 exit poll missed by a large margin the result.          According to the SWS exit poll, 45% of Muslims voted for Binay, while only 17% chose Roxas and 28% for Legarda. About 75% of the members of the Iglesia ni Cristo voted for Roxas. Despite having the endorsement of several Catholic bishops, de los Reyes only got 0.2% of the Catholic vote, while Aquino, despite being branded by some Catholic organizations as not pro-life, got 44%.          The candidate in each position with the highest amount of votes is declared the winner; there is no runoff. Congress shall canvass the votes in joint public session.          When there are two or more candidates who have an equal and highest amount of votes, Congress, voting separately via majority vote, will choose among the candidates who have an equal and highest amount of votes to be the president.          The Supreme Court shall ""be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the President or Vice President"".          There are several parallel tallies, with the Congressional canvass the official tally. The COMELEC used the election returns from the polling precincts; the Congress as the national board of canvassers will base their official tally from the certificates of canvass from the provinces and cities, which were derived from the election returns. The accredited citizen's arm, the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) also used the election returns from the polling precincts. In theory, all tallies must be identitcal.          Congress in joint session as the National Board of Canvassers convened in the Batasang Pambansa Complex in Quezon City, the home of the House of Representatives. Only a committee canvassed the votes, with the same number of members from both the Senate and the House of Representatives.          On June 8, Congress finished canvassing all of the votes, with the final canvass showing that Aquino and Binay had won. Aquino and Binay were proclaimed as president-elect and vice president-elect in a joint session on June 9. The president-elect and vice president-elect were inaugurated on June 30, 2010.          In case a president has not been determined by June 30, the vice president-elect shall act as president until a president has been determined. If both positions have not yet been determined, the President of the Senate, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the former is unable to do so, shall act as president. Congress shall enact a law on who acts as president if neither of officials already stated are unable to do so.          The candidate with the highest number of votes wins the vice presidency. In case when two or more candidates have the highest number of votes, one of them shall be chosen by the vote of a majority of all the members of both Houses of the Congress, voting separately.          Margin of victory is less than 5% for the presidential election:          Margin of victory is less than 5% for the vice presidential election:          The COMELEC originally released results for president and vice president based from election returns but stopped in order not to preempt Congress. The COMELEC held their tally at the Philippine International Convention Center at Pasay.          The PPCRV held their tally at the Pope Pius Center in Manila.          Source: Exit polls conducted by Pulse Asia          Source: Exit polls conducted by Pulse Asia          According to the Fair Elections Act, the COMELEC's cap on spending is 10 pesos per voter for each candidate and another 5 pesos per voter for one's political party; since there are about 50 million voters, a candidate can spend up to 500 million pesos and a party can spend an additional 250 million pesos.

Healthcare technician's primary position is to assist medical staff complete tasks around their assigned unit or clinic's and accommodate patient needs.          Healthcare technicians are typically found in specialty clinics, intensive care, emergency departments, or laboratory collection facilities. Technicians will perform basic cardiology reports such as, EKG's and will have basic understanding of bodily function. The technician is an integral member of the unit-based healthcare team, they contribute to the continuity of care by decreasing fragmentation through decentralization of selected diagnostic and therapeutic treatment modalities.          Healthcare technicians provide two levels of care, direct and indirect. Often, technicians are trained and qualified to complete specialty tasks and this varies depending on clinic needs. Healthcare technicians provide a key role in patient care and cleanliness of hospital units. Healthcare technicians or HCT are also known as Patient Care Technician (PCT) or Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA).HCT's objectives are to provide basic nursing care, use communication skills to assist patients to adapting to common health problems, provide continuity of care, demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for learning purposes, and proper demonstration for accountability purposes. HCT's can assist the medical team while evaluating patients on a routine basis within primary care clinics. They can be trained to ask emotional health questions/survey's to evaluate the standing of patients mental health. This screening measure performed by HCT's can help create awareness and assist in the diagnosis and prevention of patient depression.          Qualified members performing direct patient care can have the opportunity work directly with patients and assist with their care and well being. This type of care involves the following duties:          According to a recent article the following tasks met as the highest job priority for healthcare technicians: Blood draws, arterial gases, venous access through IV insertion, central line dressing changes, electrocardiograms, patient monitoring, oxygen requirements, breathing exercises, and vital signs. HCT's are at the forefront of healthcare and can assist in the addressing issues or concerns within the healthcare structure. They can be utilized to mention gaps or strengths when addressing chronic pain patients within the healthcare system. The empathetic approach that HCT's use while on the job can assist medical teams better care for patients facing chronic health illnesses.          Aside from routine patient care, healthcare technicians will complete many duties outside of direct care. The indirect care performed by healthcare technicians will ensure continuity of care. Technicians will maintain clinic or units with:          Although healthcare technicians perform several direct and indirect tasks, they also perform specialty duties. These duties are delegated to ensure clinic specific needs are met. These duties include:          Most allied health programs are of associate degree levels or state issued certification. A potential student will need to complete a certified program and a clinical externship. The duration of most programs is 10–24 weeks and vary with credit load.

Also, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected, 29% employment growth from 2012-2022.          There is a growing need for a cohort of compentent technicians to support the range of occupational health service delivery and to release nurses from some of the more routine tasks of their day-to-day work.          Most duties performed while working are distributed by several technicians. Although many tasks are at times stressful, one must complete these jobs effortlessly and without error. The most difficult task while working is successfully being able to manage multiple units (or offices) and be efficient. Throughout an 8 hour day a tech may be assigned to 1-4 different areas and have to have direct or indirect care with patients. Duties will often include lifting, prolonged standing, blood-draw, and patient bathing needs. Each job performed will have annual competencies completed to ensure patient safety standards are compliant.          Each technician is trained with levels of priority. This can be described as the time frame at which one completes certain tasks or duties. For example: a technician will be given blood cultures (a lab specimen collected to verify the growth of bacterium in the blood system.), routine lab collections, glucose testing, and equipment processing (cleaning of medical equipment). Depending on staffing levels a technician will have to determine which task will need completed first per priority level. This will be established by the technician based upon patient needs or volume of patients needing testing, staffing levels, and the efficiency level at which they can complete the most work.",['Allied health professions']

7407556,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7407556,Newport YMCA A.F.C.,"Newport YMCA Association Football Club are a football team based in the city of Newport, South Wales. They currently play in the Welsh Football League Second Division.          They were founded in 1973 with the merging of the Newport Central YMCA and Newport Pill YMCA sides and were elected to the Welsh Football League in 1978. Newport YMCA had good Welsh Cup results in the 2000s as they reached the Fifth Round of the competition on various occasions. This resulted in them facing off against three Welsh Premier League sides: Carmarthen Town, Welshpool Town & Bangor City.          Newport YMCA Football Club was formed in 1973 when the Newport Central YMCA and Newport Pill YMCA sides merged to form one club.          The merger took place as a result of a decision made by the Board of Management who were responsible for running the affairs of the YMCA in Newport at that time. They believed that it would be in the best interests of both clubs for them to merge and share facilities. After many months of negotiation the two sides, usually fierce rivals on the park, merged to form the one Club, Newport YMCA.          Prior to the merger both sides were successful teams in their own right. Pill YMCA playing in the higher standard Gwent Premier League and Central YMCA in the Newport & District League Premier X Division.          Pill YMCA who had moved onto an eight-acre ground at Mendalgief Road in 1955, boasted two football pitches and a rugby pitch, but suffered from poor changing facilities, whilst Central YMCA situated in the town centre, had better changing facilities, but no ground of their own. At the time of the merger Central YMCA ran five senior sides and Pill YMCA ran two senior sides and a range of junior sides.          The merger proved an instant success with the club running five senior teams plus junior teams from under-12s to under-18s. Cups and trophies came the clubs way on an annual basis.          In 1978 after winning the Gwent Premier League four times in succession they gained election to the Welsh Football League.          Under the management of Michael Carvell the club worked its way up to the Premier Division, which at that time was the highest level of football in South Wales. In 1980–81 the club made it to the final of the Welsh Intermediate Cup (formerly known as the Welsh Amateur Cup) only to lose the game 1–0 to Connah's Quay Nomads.          The pinnacle of success came when the side finished in 3rd place in the Premier Division in 1982–83, their highest-ever finish in the Welsh football pyramid. Despite this high finish the creation of the ‘National Division’ for season 1983–84 effectively demoted the YM, their lack of facilities costing them a place in the newly created division.          In 1990 The Board of Management at the YMCA decided to sell off the Central YMCA building and half of the land at Mendalgief Road, using the money to finance a new purpose-built facility in Pill. For one season the club were forced to play their home games at Somerton Park, home of Newport County, as uncertainty over the sale of the land and building work meant the club needed to find an alternative venue for home games.          After spending the 1990–91 season at Somerton Park the YM returned to their home at Mendalgief Road as the sale of the land failed to materialise, causing building work to be delayed. Unfortunately the uncertainty over events off the field transmitted itself to the football club and the retirement of older players plus the inability to attract new ones caused the club to suffer relegation at the end of the 1992–93 season.          The new building that was planned for 1991 eventually opened in January 2000 and this marked an upturn in the fortunes of the club. In season 2001–2002 the YMCA started their comeback back by winning the Division 3 championship. Two seasons later the club finished just one place below a promotion spot, but in season 2004–05 they secured a return to the top division of Welsh League football by finishing runners-up to Pontardawe in Division 2.          Newport YMCA have many local rivals in the city of Newport. Newport YMCA have in recent years enjoyed clashes with cross-city rivals Caerleon and Llanwern. During the 2008–2009 season, they began a rivalry with Cwmbran Town, who had previously been relegated from the Welsh Premier League.          At youth level Newport YMCA have a rivalry with Newport County but at senior level the teams do not compete in the same league system. The used to play each other in an annual preseason friendly. The last time they met was in 2004, twice.

The song soon became popular on Christian rock radio, charting at number one in February 2008. It was 2008's 14th most played song of the year on Christian contemporary hit radio.          The song is about having triumph and victory over past circumstances and has been described as ""anthemic"". The theme of ""Unbreakable"" was partially inspired by a fan's question asked on MySpace. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was GMA Dove Award-nominated in 2009 for Rock/Contemporary Song of the Year.          The band's style and theme changed between their debut album, ""The Healing of Harms"" (2006), and ""Unbreakable"". The first album was thematically based on ""trying to fight your way through circumstances"", while Fireflight's second project has a theme of triumph and being ""[victorious] over the things that used to control you"". According to the band members, the song ""Unbreakable"" represents that change between the two albums: ""now it's about finding power in your life"", said bassist Wendy Drennen.          The song is carried by an ""anthemic"" sound and the ""riveting vocals"" of lead vocalist Dawn Michele. Bassist Wendy Drennen said that ""Unbreakable"" was about ""overcoming a defeated mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us"". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, ""Where are the people that accused me?"" Richardson said, ""The people in charge were ready to kill her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and makes them feel ashamed for accusing her ... She knows she’s guilty, and yet she’s suddenly free and given a second chance.""

It held the position for at least three weeks, and also charted at number 14 on ""R&Rs Christian contemporary hit radio (CHR) chart; it was the most-added song of the week on the CHR format in mid February. It reached a peak position on the ""Billboard"" Hot Christian Songs chart of number 20 in early April.          At the end of 2008 ""Unbreakable"" was the 14th most-played song of the year on Christian contemporary hit radio. In February 2009, it received a GMA Dove Award nomination for Rock/Contemporary Song of the Year.          The song was generally received well by critics. Jesus Freak Hideout editor John DiBiase called it a ""powerful anthem"" and said that the opening track was ""merely the tip of the iceberg"" for the album's quality among the other tracks. Bob Felberg of The Phantom Tollbooth was favorable towards the song, saying, ""'Unbreakable' ...is one of the strongest Christian rock songs in a long time, both in music and lyrics"", and that it featured ""a slinky-like guitar and strings interacting before slamming rhythms blow your hair straight back"". In response to ""Unbreakable"" being featured on NBC's ""Bionic Woman"", The Phantom Tollbooth's second reviewer Bert Saraco said, ""Mainstream attention is a wonderful thing, of course, but often signals a necessarily generic element to a project that sometimes sends out danger signals as to its artistic or creative potential."" Tony Cummings of ""Cross Rhythms"" magazine said that the song was ""excellent"".          The song's music video premiered on the Gospel Music Channel on March 29, 2008. The video primarily shows the band performing in a building with dark lighting, but also depicts three people in their separate difficulties. The first is a man who was involved in a car wreck. Next shown is a woman who has suffered hair loss from chemotherapy cancer treatment, and the third individual is a teenage girl who struggles with bulimia nervosa. At the end of the song, all three have a more relaxed countenance.          The song was nominated for a Dove Award for Rock/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year at the 40th GMA Dove Awards.","['2007 singles', '2007 songs']"

It took place on 1 August 1993 at Donington Park.          6th pole of the season for Kevin Schwantz; Wayne Rainey highsides in practice—he loses two fingernails, gets a fracture in his spine and a concussion; he doesn’t qualify well.          Rainey gets the start.          Rainey has the lead from Alex Barros, Schwantz and Mick Doohan. Approaching the chicane, Doohan leaves the braking too late and slams into the back of Barros on his right, then falls to his left and takes out Schwantz. Schwantz looks injured. Rainey’s championship hopes suddenly look bright, with Carl Fogarty and Luca Cadalora behind him.          Fogarty is adjusting his front brakes on-the-fly; Cadalora comes past.          Àlex Crivillé, who’d been in a battle with Shinichi Itoh, crashes out.          Rainey and Cadalora at the front; Cadalora looks like he’s staying behind Rainey purposely, but then passes. Watching on the race monitors, team manager Kenny Roberts shakes his head at Cadalora’s disregard for Rainey’s championship struggle. It will be Cadalora’s first 500 win.          Fogarty looks to have a strong 3rd, but seems to be running out of gas and is pipped at the line by Niall Mackenzie.          Rainey is now 3 points behind Schwantz with 4 rounds to go.          Cadalora: “When I saw that Kevin was out and he didn’t get point (sic), I was thinking it was not big trouble, because 20 points more for Wayne. That’s good.” Had Cadalora stayed in 2nd, Rainey would be 2 points ahead, not 3 points behind.          Roberts: “I’m very happy for Luca, because to win a 500 grand prix for Luca is fantastic. But, I have to run the Marlboro Yamaha team, and for the team, it would have been better that Wayne won.

460642,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460642,Equicontinuity,"In mathematical analysis, a family of functions is equicontinuous if all the functions are continuous and they have equal variation over a given neighbourhood, in a precise sense described herein. In particular, the concept applies to countable families, and thus ""sequences"" of functions.          The equicontinuity appears in the formulation of Ascoli's theorem, which states that a subset of ""C""(""X""), the space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space ""X"", is compact if and only if it is closed, pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. As a corollary, a sequence in ""C""(""X"") is uniformly convergent if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise to a function (not necessarily continuous a-priori). In particular, the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions ""f"" on either metric space or locally compact space is continuous. If, in addition, ""f"" are holomorphic, then the limit is also holomorphic.          The uniform boundedness principle states that a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces is equicontinuous.          Let ""X"" and ""Y"" be two metric spaces, and ""F"" a family of functions from ""X"" to ""Y"".          The family ""F"" is equicontinuous at a point ""x"" ∈ ""X"" if for every ε > 0, there exists a  δ > 0 such that ""d""(""ƒ""(""x""), ""ƒ""(""x"")) < ε for all ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"" and all ""x"" such that ""d""(""x"", ""x"") < δ. The family is pointwise equicontinuous if it is equicontinuous at each point of ""X"".          The family ""F"" is uniformly equicontinuous if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that ""d""(""ƒ""(""x""), ""ƒ""(""x"")) < ε for all ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"" and all ""x"", ""x"" ∈ ""X"" such that ""d""(""x"", ""x"") < δ.          For comparison, the statement 'all functions ""ƒ"" in ""F"" are continuous' means that for every ε > 0, every ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"", and every ""x"" ∈ ""X"", there exists a δ > 0 such that ""d""(""ƒ""(""x""), ""ƒ""(""x"")) < ε for all ""x"" ∈ ""X"" such that ""d""(""x"", ""x"") < δ.          More generally, when ""X"" is a topological space, a set ""F"" of functions from ""X"" to ""Y"" is said to be equicontinuous at ""x"" if for every ε > 0, ""x"" has a neighborhood ""U"" such that          for all and ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"". This definition usually appears in the context of topological vector spaces.          When ""X"" is compact, a set is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if it is equicontinuous at every point, for essentially the same reason as that uniform continuity and continuity coincide on compact spaces. Used on its own, the term ""equiconituity"" may refer to either the pointwise or uniform notion, depending on the context. On a compact space, these notions coincide.          Some basic properties follow immediately from the definition. Every finite set of continuous functions is equicontinuous. The closure of an equicontinuous set is again equicontinuous. Every member of a uniformly equicontinuous set of functions is uniformly continuous, and every finite set of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly equicontinuous.          Let ""X"" be a compact Hausdorff space, and equip ""C""(""X"") with the uniform norm, thus making ""C""(""X"") a Banach space, hence a metric space. Then Arzelà–Ascoli theorem states that a subset of ""C""(""X"") is compact if and only if it is closed, uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. This is analogous to the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that subsets of R are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded. As a corollary, every uniformly bounded equicontinuous sequence in ""C""(""X"") contains a subsequence that converges uniformly to a continuous function on ""X"".          In view of Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, a sequence in ""C""(""X"") converges uniformly if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise. The hypothesis of the statement can be weakened a bit: a sequence in ""C""(""X"") converges uniformly if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise on a dense subset to some function on ""X"" (not assumed continuous). This weaker version is typically used to prove Arzelà–Ascoli theorem for separable compact spaces. Another consequence is that the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions on a metric space, or on a locally compact space, is continuous. (See below for an example.) In the above, the hypothesis of compactness of ""X""  cannot be relaxed. To see that, consider a compactly supported continuous function ""g"" on R with ""g""(0) = 1, and consider the equicontinuous sequence of functions on R defined by ""ƒ""(""x"") = . Then, ""ƒ"" converges pointwise to 0 but does not converge uniformly to 0.          This criterion for uniform convergence is often useful in real and complex analysis. Suppose we are given a sequence of continuous functions that converges pointwise on some open subset ""G"" of R. As noted above, it actually converges uniformly on a compact subset of ""G"" if it is equicontinuous on the compact set. In practice, showing the equicontinuity is often not so difficult. For example, if the sequence consists of differentiable functions or functions with some regularity (e.g., the functions are solutions of a differential equation), then the mean value theorem or some other kinds of estimates can be used to show the sequence is equicontinuous. It then follows that the limit of the sequence is continuous on every compact subset of ""G""; thus, continuous on ""G"". A similar argument can be made when the functions are holomorphic. One can use, for instance, Cauchy's estimate to show the equicontinuity (on a compact subset) and conclude that the limit is holomorphic. Note that the equicontinuity is essential here. For example, ""ƒ""(""x"") = converges to a multiple of the discontinuous sign function.          Let ""E"", ""F"" be Banach spaces, and Γ be a family of continuous linear operators from ""E"" into ""F"". Then Γ is equicontinuous if and only if          that is, Γ is uniformly bounded in operator norm. Also, by linearity, Γ is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if it is equicontinuous at 0.          The uniform boundedness principle (also known as the Banach–Steinhaus theorem) states that Γ is equicontinuous if it is pointwise bounded; i.e., for each . The result can be generalized to a case when F is locally convex and E is a barreled space.          Alaoglu's theorem states that if ""E"" is a topological vector space, then every equicontinuous subset of ""E*"" is weak-* relatively compact.          The most general scenario in which equicontinuity can be defined is for topological spaces whereas ""uniform"" equicontinuity requires the filter of neighbourhoods of one point to be somehow comparable with the filter of neighbourhood of another point. The latter is most generally done via a uniform structure, giving a uniform space. Appropriate definitions in these cases are as follows:          A weaker concept is that of even continuity:          For metric spaces, there are standard topologies and uniform structures derived from the metrics, and then these general definitions are equivalent to the metric-space definitions.          Stochastic equicontinuity is a version of equicontinuity used in the context of sequences of functions of random variables, and their convergence.","['Continuous mappings', 'Mathematical analysis']"
49536765,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49536765,Crazy Eyes (Filter album),"Crazy Eyes is the seventh studio album by American industrial rock band Filter. The album was released on April 8, 2016. The first single, ""Take Me to Heaven"", was released in January 2016. In its opening week, the album debuted at number 151 on the Billboard 200 charts, the band's lowest debut to date.          Similar to several other Filter albums, prior to recording, the band received an entire lineup change besides frontman and band founder Richard Patrick. New members recruited included guitarist Oumi Kapila, bassist Ashley Dzerigian, drummer Chris Reeve and keyboardist Bobby Miller.          The album marked a change in sound from prior Filter albums, moving into a direction Patrick coined as ""new industrial"". He described it as ""...more experimental and crazy...scary, weird places instead of doing that big-ass guitar sound again."" ""Billboard"" described it as ""...hardly bereft of guitars but there are a substantial amount of electronics and effects in use. The result features heavy industrial crunch and solemn, ambient songs that reach back to Patrick’s time in Nine Inch Nails and the first Filter album, 1995’s ""Short Bus"".          Thematically, the album still keeps with the band's themes of frustration and anger. Additionally, Patrick described it as an attempt ""to look at people's unexplainable behavior and assess it, using sound. It's a way to approximate the insanity of the human condition."" The track ""Take Me to Heaven"" was written by Patrick's struggle with dealing with the death of his father. Patrick recalled: I was looking into the eyes of my father when he was passing away, and I held his hand...He glanced at me really quickly, focused on me, had this look of gratitude, and then he slipped away. I was almost like, 'I hope you're going to heaven'. Scientifically, the idea doesn't make any sense to me, but if there is a heaven, take me there.          The track ""Nothing in My Hands"" was written about the Ferguson and Michael Brown shootings.          The album's first single, ""Take Me to Heaven"", was first premiered on the ""Billboard"" website in January 2016. The album is scheduled for release on April 8, 2016, through Wind-Up Records. Two days before release, ""Billboard"" put up the entire album for streaming. 'Crazy Eyes' debuted at #151 on the Billboard 200, selling 5,000 copies in its first week.          The album was generally well received. Allmusic praised the album for being something new while still being familiar to Patrick's past with Filter and Nine Inch Nails, describing it as ""Less politically on the nose than the poppy ""Anthems for the Damned"", more mature than the easy retread of ""The Trouble with Angels"", and more visceral than ""The Sun Comes Out Tonight"" and ultimately that ""Crazy Eyes"" manages to tread new ground for Filter while respectfully acknowledging the sound that propelled the band in the first place. The Sputnik Music staff review echoes these sentiments, stating that the album was better than Filter's last few albums, but that ""though harder to digest on a first listen, these songs gradually get under your skin, revealing one of Filter’s greatest LPs to date."" Renowned for Sound was less positive about the album, criticizing Patrick's rough vocals and concluding that ""Patrick tries to cover too much ground on one record, creating the feeling of a collection of songs instead of the feeling of an album. Had ""Crazy Eyes"" featured a unity of purpose, the great songs on the record could have been extended to making a great album.

Samuelson, were married in 1936 and had two children.          Samuelson served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a weapons instructor and gunsmith at the Farragut Naval Training Station, a major inland training facility at Lake Pend Oreille in northern Idaho.          After the war, Samuelson stayed in the area; he brought his family out from Illinois and opened a sporting goods store in nearby Sandpoint. He also had an interest in a business that sold and leased mining and logging equipment.          A conservative, Samuelson was encouraged to run for the state in 1960 by Governor Robert Smylie. Samuelson won and was re-elected in 1962 and 1964. After the Democratic landslide of 1964, he decided to run for governor in 1966, which was still held by three-term incumbent Smylie, a moderate Republican from Boise and former state attorney general. In a heated race that drew national attention to the Republican gubernatorial primary, Samuelson won handily, 61 to 39%.

The pilot of the twin-engine Piper PA-23 was the only survivor. Occurring only seven weeks before the election, the Democrats nominated the runner-up in the primary, state senator Cecil Andrus of Orofino, whom Samuelson defeated by over 10,000 votes. During the 1970 gubernatorial campaign, Samuelson supported molybdenum mining in central Idaho's White Cloud Mountains, and was defeated for re-election by Andrus – a staunch opponent of the mining development – and returned to private life.

A few facilities from this period still remain on the temple grounds, including a cistern and iron pot for serving food and water to thousands of monks.           It continued to play an important role in subsequent centuries, but shrank as the state's support for Buddhism disappeared under the Joseon Dynasty. Joseon Dynasty founder Taejo is said to have retired to a spot near Beopjusa after tiring of his sons' fighting.          Beopjusa Temple owns a number of cultural heritage items: 3 national treasures; 12 miscellaneous treasures; 21 items of tangible cultural heritage of Chungcheongbukdo; and 1 item of cultural heritage material. In addition, the temple itself is designated Historic Site No. 503, the region Scenic Site No. 61, and it is also home to two natural monuments.           Among its cultural heritage possessions, one is truly unique. It is the only wooden pagoda in Korea that has preserved its original appearance, named Palsangjeon (National Treasure No. 55). Originally there were two such structures in Korea, but when the Main Buddha Hall at Ssangbongsa Temple burnt down in 1984, Palsangjeon became the only surviving wooden pagoda designated a cultural heritage. In a hall open on four sides, the Huigyeon Bosal (The Beautiful Bodhisattva, Sudarsana) (Treasure No. 1417) is enshrined. This bodhisattva stands on a foundation stone and carries an incense burner on his head to fulfill his vow to offer incense to the Buddha for eternity.          The Folding Screen of Celestial Charts (Treasure No. 848) is a cultural heritage not directly related to Buddhism. Featuring 300 constellations consisting of 3,083 stars, the Charts were created by Kim Tae-seo and An Guk-bin, two scholars from the Meteorological Administration. They are based on charts their teacher, I. Koegler, made in 1723 during his stay in China. Of all the celestial charts made by Koegler, this one is the largest and most accurate, thus giving it international value as well. It is thought that these charts were given to Beopjusa Temple by King Yeongjo when the Wondang (Prayer Shrine) for the king’s deceased Royal Concubine Yeongbin of the Yi Clan was established here.           Another unusual heritage is the stele of Ven. Jajeong Gukjon (慈淨國尊: 1240-1327) (Tangible Cultural Heritage of Chungcheongbukdo No. 79). A memorial to this monk who had risen to the rank of National Preceptor was inscribed on the natural stone cliff by royal decree of King Chunghye. Seonhuigung Wondang, a structure located behind the Main Buddha Hall, is the prayer shrine for Yeongbin of the Yi Clan, the mother of Crown Prince Sado and a royal concubine of King Yeongjo. Having the same name as her shrine in the Chilgung Shrine Complex (where ancestral tablets of seven royal concubines are kept), it is unusual a prayer shrine for a royal concubine be located in a temple.           Another cultural heritage relic to see is the Stone Pot, Tangible Cultural Heritage of Chungcheongbuk-do No. 204. A stone sculpture in the shape of an earthen pot, it is partially buried in the ground at a site 40 meters (131 feet) left of Chongji Seon Center. Cultural heritage experts have no idea about its purpose, but legend says it was used to store kimchi.           Beopjusa was chosen by Bruce Lee as the original setting for the movie ""Game of Death"", with the five floors of Palsangjeon pagoda representing five different martial arts. Since Bruce Lee died before the movie was completed, the screenplay was changed, and Beopjusa was edited out.          It also offers temple stay programs where visitors can experience Buddhist culture.","['Buddhist temples in South Korea', 'Boeun County', 'Buddhist temples of the Jogye Order', 'Buildings and structures in North Chungcheong Province', '653 establishments', 'Religious organizations established in the 7th century', 'Visitor attractions in North Chungcheong Province']"
5392262,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5392262,Shabaka Stone,"The Shabaka Stone, sometimes Shabaqo, is a relic from the Nubian Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt incised with an Egyptian religious text. It is a composition of breccia measuring 91 cm on the left in height and 95 cm on the right as well as 137 cm in width. The text claims to contain the surviving content of a worm-ridden, decaying papyrus that was found as pharaoh Shabaka was inspecting the temple of Ptah in Memphis, Egypt. In later years, the stone is believed to have been used as a millstone damaging the hieroglyphics. This damage is accompanied by other intentional defacements, leaving the hieroglyphics in poor condition.          It was once placed within the Temple of Ptah in Memphis in the 8th century BCE. It was removed at an unknown date. In 1805, the stone was a donation by George John, 2nd earl of Spencer, to the British Museum where it has been located since. It is known that prior to coming to England it was in Alexandria, but how it got there or when is unknown.          Since this stone was meant to be a preservation of an older text, the question regarding the dating of the original work has been sought after. Attempts to attribute a definite date for the original text have been inconclusive. Some scholars claimed it originated in the Old Kingdom while others said it went further back. Today, scholars feel it is clear that it cannot predate the Nineteenth Dynasty.          The text includes two main divisions with a short introduction and an ending summary. The first division relates the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Ptah works through Horus to accomplish this unification. The other is a creation story that establishes Ptah as the creator of all things, including gods.           Ptah also centers in all things such as the heart and tongue of his creations, and thus, in a sense, making him the center of existence. The manner of creation came by Ptah's thoughts in his heart that were then uttered by his tongue. This creation story is sometimes referred to as a Memphite Theology.

4982245,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4982245,Degen's eight-square identity,"In mathematics, Degen's eight-square identity establishes that the product of two numbers, each of which being a sum of eight squares, is itself the sum of eight squares.          Namely:          First discovered by around 1818, the identity was independently rediscovered by John Thomas Graves (1843) and Arthur Cayley (1845). The latter two derived it while working on an extension of quaternions called octonions. In algebraic terms the identity means that the norm of product of two octonions equals the product of their norms: formula_10. Similar statements are true for quaternions (Euler's four-square identity), complex numbers (the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci two-square identity) and real numbers. In 1898 Adolf Hurwitz proved that there is no similar bilinear identity for 16 squares (sedenions) or any other number of squares except for 1,2,4, and 8. However, in the 1960s, H. Zassenhaus, W. Eichhorn, and A. Pfister (independently) showed there can be a non-bilinear identity for 16 squares.           Note that each quadrant reduces to a version of Euler's four-square identity:          and similarly for the other three quadrants. By Pfister's theorem, a different sort of eight-square identity can be given where the formula_16, introduced below, are non-bilinear and merely rational functions of the formula_17. Thus,          where,          and,          with,          Incidentally, the formula_32 obey the identity,","['Analytic number theory', 'Mathematical identities']"

31575682,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31575682,Jason Stearns,"Jason K. Stearns is an American writer who worked for ten years in the Congo, including three years during the Second Congo War. He first traveled to the Congo in 2001 to work for a local human rights organization, Héritiers de la Justice, in Bukavu. He went on to work for the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUC). In 2008 Stearns was named by the UN Secretary General to lead a special UN investigation into the violence in the country.          Stearns is the author of the book, """", and the blog, ""Congo Siasa"". He received a Ph.D. in political science from Yale University on May 24, 2016.          Jason Stearns was born in San Francisco in 1976 to Stephen C. Stearns, an evolutionary biologist, and Beverly Peterson Stearns, a journalist. He has an older brother, Justin, who is professor of Middle Eastern history at New York University.          At the age of six, the family moved to Switzerland, where Stephen Stearns taught biology at the University of Basel. Stearns attended Swiss public school in Arlesheim and Muenchenstein, on the outskirts of Basel, and spent a year in Laja, Chile, on an exchange program. Upon graduation from Gymnasium Muenchenstein, he volunteered at the Swiss Tropical Institute's field research station in Ifakara, Tanzania.          In 1997, Jason joined his older brother in the United States, attending first Hampshire College and then neighboring Amherst College in Massachusetts. He graduated with a degree in political science. Having been accepted to law school at Harvard Law School, he traveled to Bukavu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to volunteer with Héritiers de la Justice, a local human rights group in September 2001. Deferring law school, he went on to work for the International Human Rights Law Group and the United Nations peacekeeping operation MONUC for the following two years. He eventually decided not to attend law school, enrolling in a PhD program in political science at Yale University in 2009.          Between 2005 and 2007, Stearns was based in Nairobi, Kenya, as a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group, working on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. In 2007, he left to spend a year and a half researching and writing Dancing in the Glory of Monsters, a history of the Congo wars of 1996-2003, based on interviews with leading protagonists of the conflict. The title stems from a speech given by Congolese President Laurent Kabila in which he castigates Congolese for blaming their woes on a few political leaders, suggesting that the political malaise in the country is a more systemic problem. The book, which was eventually published in 2011, received critical acclaim in major newspapers and magazines.          In 2008, Stearns was named as coordinator of the United Nations Group of Experts on the Congo, a panel responsible for researching support and financing of armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. In their final report, the Group found both the Rwandan and Congolese governments guilty of violating United Nations sanctions. According to eyewitness testimony, phone records and other documentary evidence, the Rwandan government had provided military support to the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP) rebel group, while the Congolese government had collaborated with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebels, as well as other Congolese armed groups.          Following the report, the Swedish and Dutch government temporarily suspended aid to the Rwandan government. Several months after the publication of the report, the Rwandan government arrested the leader of the CNDP, Laurent Nkunda, and struck a peace deal with the Congolese government.          In 2010, Stearns married Lusungu Kayani, a Tanzanian-American employee of the United Nations and a fashion and textile entrepreneur.

685527,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=685527,San Joaquin (train),"The San Joaquin (sometimes referred to as San Joaquins) is a passenger train operated by Amtrak, with funding from the California Department of Transportation as part of the Amtrak California network in California's Central Valley. Fourteen trains a day run between its southern terminus at Bakersfield and Stockton, where the route splits to Oakland (five trains each way per day) or Sacramento (two trains each way per day). At Bakersfield, Thruway Motorcoach service offers connections to the ""Pacific Surfliner"" at Los Angeles Union Station, several points in Southern California, the High Desert and the Central Coast. At Emeryville, Thruway Motorcoach service offers connections to San Francisco.          The ""San Joaquin"" is Amtrak's fifth-busiest service and the railroad's third-busiest in California. During fiscal year 2013 (FY2013), the service carried a record 1.2 million passengers, a 6.6% increase from FY2012. Total revenue during FY2013 was , a 1.9% increase over FY2012.          On July 1, 2015, management and governance of the San Joaquins passed to the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority.          The ""San Joaquin"" runs over lines that once hosted several passenger trains a day. The top trains were the ""Golden Gate"" on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (predecessor to BNSF), and the ""San Joaquin Daylight"" on the Southern Pacific Railroad (later acquired by Union Pacific). Prior to 1960s service cutbacks passenger service continued south of Bakersfield, to Glendale and Los Angeles.          In April 1965 as ridership on passenger trains continued to drop, the Santa Fe Railway received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to severely curtail ""Golden Gate"" operations, with service finally abandoned three years later. The ""San Joaquin Daylight"" was discontinued with the start-up of Amtrak in May 1971.          Other passenger trains that ran through the Central Valley included Southern Pacific's ""Owl"" and Santa Fe's ""San Francisco Chief"" and ""Valley Flyer"".          Amtrak routed all Los Angeles-San Francisco service over the Southern Pacific's Coast Line in its initial 1971 route structure, leaving the San Joaquin Valley without service. Both the Southern Pacific (""San Joaquin Daylight"") and the Santa Fe (""San Francisco Chief"") had served the region. Beginning in 1972 Amtrak revisited the decision at the urging of area congressmen, notably Bernice F. Sisk, who favored service between Oakland and Barstow or, failing that, Barstow and Sacramento. Service began on March 5, 1974 with one round-trip per day between Bakersfield and Oakland and a bus connection from Bakersfield to Los Angeles. Amtrak chose the Santa Fe route over the Southern Pacific, citing the higher speed ( vs. ) of the Santa Fe and freight congestion on the Southern Pacific. The decision was not without controversy, with Sisk alleging that the Southern Pacific lobbied the Nixon Administration to influence the decision.          In 1979 Amtrak proposed discontinuing the ""San Joaquin"" as part of system-wide reductions ordered by the Carter Administration. The state of California stepped in to provide a yearly subsidy (then $700,000) to cover the train's operating losses, and it was retained. At the time the state asked Amtrak to add a second daily frequency between Oakland and Bakersfield, and to extend the service south over the Tehachapi Pass to Los Angeles. Amtrak added the second train in February 1980, but attempts to extend the train over the Tehachapi Loop failed due to Southern Pacific's opposition.          To this day the ""San Joaquin"" does not continue south of Bakersfield because the only line between Bakersfield and points south, the Tehachapi Pass, is one of the world's busiest single-track freight rail lines.          Over the past 30 years service has increased from just one round trip per day to four round trips to Oakland, plus two round trips to Sacramento.          For its first two years of operation the ""San Joaquin"" used single-level coaches Amtrak had inherited from other railroads. In October 1976 Amtrak ""Amfleeted"" the ""San Joaquin"", introducing new Amfleet coaches to the service. From 1987-1989 Amtrak used Superliner and ex-ATSF Hi-Level coaches. For a short period beginning on June 15, 1987, this included a full dining car on one of the trains. Amtrak requipped the ""San Joaquin"" trains again in 1989, this time with new Horizon coaches, when service expanded to three daily round-trips. The ""San Joaquin"" began receiving the Superliner-derived ""California Cars"" that it uses today in 1995.          Amtrak California operates its own fleet of EMD F59PHI and GE P32-8WH locomotives that are used on ""San Joaquin"" trains. These locomotives are owned by Caltrans and carry its CDTX reporting marks. Amtrak owned locomotives are also occasionally used on the ""San Joaquin"", including the P42DC.          The ""San Joaquin"" is equipped with Amtrak California's fleet of ""California Car"" bi-level, high-capacity passenger cars owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Each trainset typically consists of two coach cars, a coach/baggage car, a café (dining) car, and a cab/coach car. The cab/coach car is a similar to other coaches but with an engineer's operating cab and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode, which eliminates the need to turn the train at each end-point. Caltrans is in the process of refitting the cab/coach cars to have a space on car's lower level for storage for checked luggage and bikes.          Caltrans also owns several Surfliner bi-level cars that are used on some San Joaquin trainsets. The newer cars look very similar to the California Car fleet, but feature reclining seats, open overhead luggage racks and a restroom on the upper-level of each car.          In 2007 Caltrans paid to repair several wreck-damaged Superliner I coaches in exchange for a six-year lease of the Amtrak owned cars that are normally used on long-distance trains. 4 of these cars are painted to match the ""California car"" livery and often appear in service on the ""San Joaquin"" route in place of a coach/baggage car.          Increasing ridership on the ""San Joaquin"" led Caltrans to purchase 14 Comet IB rail cars from New Jersey Transit in 2008 for $75,000 per car. The former commuter cars refurbished and reconfigured by Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops to serve as intercity coaches at a cost of approximately $20 million. The refurbished cars have reclining inter-city seats with tray tables (4 per row), AmtrakConnect WiFi, two power outlets at each seat pair, luggage racks, trash/recycling bins, a restroom, and 6 workstation tables in the center of the car.          Caltrans has also paid to lease and refurbish 3 Non-Powered Control Units (F40PH locomotives converted into cab/baggage cars) and 3 Horizon Dinettes to serve as café cars (using the same equipment as other Amtrak California trains).          These single-level cars will be used to create two ""Comet car"" trainsets that will run between Oakland and Bakersfield. That will allow Caltrans to break up two bi-level ""California car"" trainsets to use the cars to add another coach car to each of the San Joaquin's remaining ""California Car"" trainsets.          Caltrans had planned to use the ""Comet car"" trainsets on trains starting in July 2013, but the refurbishing process took longer than expected. The first ""Comet car"" trainset was put into regular service on October 21, 2013 and the second trainset was put into regular service on April 15, 2014.          The ""San Joaquin"" runs from Bakersfield's Truxtun Avenue Station northward on BNSF Railway's Mojave Subdivision within Bakersfield, the Bakersfield Subdivision from Bakersfield to Calwa (Fresno), then on the Stockton Subdivision from Calwa to Stockton.          At Stockton the routes split to Oakland or Sacramento:","['Public transportation in the San Joaquin Valley Area', 'Public transportation in Kings County, California', 'Public transportation in Fresno County, California', 'Public transportation in Madera County, California', 'Public transportation in Merced County, California', 'Public transportation in Stanislaus County, California', 'Public transportation in San Joaquin County, California', 'Public transportation in Sacramento County, California', 'Public transportation in Contra Costa County, California', 'Public transportation in Alameda County, California', 'Public transportation in Los Angeles County, California', 'Public transportation in Southern California', 'San Joaquin Valley', 'Amtrak routes', 'Passenger rail transportation in California', 'Transportation in Kern County, California']"

Trained at the Kingston Art School, then did his military service in the Seaforth Highlanders in Malaysia ( during the Malayan Emergency). He then graduated from The Royal College of Art , London UK, in 1955. After graduating he wrote to John Fowler ( Colefax & Fowler), writing "" You are the only person in the world I want to work for"". Unfortunately, his interview with John Fowler didn't go as well as one might hope. John Fowler said to him "" What ""have"" you been doing at that college for three years? You know nothing!"".Luckily, three weeks later, Imogene Taylor of Colefax & Fowler called to offer him a position. His first celebrity job was an apartment in Eaton Square for Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh, as well as working on their country house. After a couple of years or working with John Fowler and Nancy Lancaster, he realized that he was never going to climb any higher at Colefax & Fowler, luckily Mrs. Henry ""Sister Parish"" II was in London.          John Fowler "" lent"" Keith out to Sister Parish for job in Johannesburg, who, when the job was finished, offered Keith a job in New York and $40.00 a week. So in 1957 he left England for the Big Apple, with $38.00 in his pocket. The next morning he took a cab straight from the boat to the Sutton Place home address of Sister Parish- who had forgotten that she had hired him. On the first day in the office he was handed a card that read "" Lord help the Mister who comes between you and Sister"", things went downhill from there. Keith did not like Sister Parish, and not only because he wasn't allowed to use the bathroom ( it was all women in the office), and had to go across the street to the Old Westbury Hotel, instead. He was not impressed by Sister Parish's decorating, which he said was "" appealing on the surface but without depth"". He managed to deal with the situation for nine months before he informed Sister Parish that he was leaving to start his own firm. On hearing this news Sister Parish said to him "" you will never last for a year. You don't ""know"" anyone."".          When Keith first arrived in New York he had searched for an apartment share in the New York Times, and ended up meeting Robin Roberts . Before things could really settle Keith had a partner and firm, Roberts & Irvine . Finding it difficult to find the French and English fabrics that where a staple in Keith Irvine's decorating style, Roberts and Irvine created the fabric house Clarence House. Tom Fleming became an assistant as the business took off. Before the year was out the firm split ( Keith claimed that with the influx of ""top drawer"" clients, Roberts had become a ""liability"" as he didn't ""move readily in ""polite society""', Roberts took Clarence House, and Keith left to start Keith Irvine & Co.

10447257,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10447257,Bliaut,"The bliaut or bliaud is a women's and also a men's overgarment worn from the eleventh to the thirteenth century in Western Europe, featuring voluminous skirts and horizontal puckering or pleating across a snugly fitted under bust abdomen. The sleeves are the most immediately notable difference when comparing the bliaut to other female outer clothing of the Middle Ages. They fit closely from the shoulder to approximately the elbow, and then widen from the elbow to drape to floor- or nearly floor-length. This garment's usage appears to be geographically limited to areas of French influence, with some works depicting the garment or the garment in transition as far away as Rome and modern Germany.          Examples of this garment and its evolution appear as early as the Bayeaux Tapestry, wherein a female figure wears a garment which is loose in the body, but has the extended sleeve that would be an identifying characteristic of the style after its transition. Later examples of statuary such as the jambs of the Cathedral of Chartres west façade portals show the full accomplishment of the bliaut on female saints and patrons, such as the ""Lady With Embroidered Hem,"" appearing on the left, beside the left portal Paintings and illuminated items that depict the item as well include a miniature called Ladder of Virtue dated to the twelfth century and the work of Claricia, a nun and illuminator who appears to be wearing one in her small self-portrait in a South German Psalter dated c. 1200, currently in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.          The fabrics available in this time would have been limited to woolens, linens, and silks. A fine wool or silk seems to be the best option, as linen is rather more difficult to dye a permanent color, and colored depictions of this item show a great deal of color.          The historic costuming community remains divided over the method by which the abdominal folds are achieved. Theories range from cut to lacing to fabric manipulation methods.          The achievement of skirt volume is also debated, ranging from a hipline seam with attached wide skirt to the addition of gores/godets to expand the hemline.          The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became interested in the ideals and clothing of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. As a result, the bliaut as then understood is frequently featured upon women in their works. The most popular example of this particular garment in Pre-Raphaelite art may be by Edmund Blair Leighton.","['Medieval costume', '12th century in Europe', 'French clothing']"
18934980,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18934980,Rick Alan Ross,"Rick Alan Ross (born 1952) is an American deprogrammer, cult specialist, and author. Ross has intervened in more than 350 deprogramming cases in various countries.          Ross faced charges of unlawful imprisonment over a 1991 forcible deprogramming of United Pentecostal Church International member Jason Scott; a jury acquitted him at trial. In 1995, a civil lawsuit filed by Scott resulted in a multimillion-dollar judgement against Ross and his co-defendants. Later, Ross and Scott reached a settlement in which Ross agreed to pay Scott 5,000 and provide 200 hours of professional services at no charge.          Ross was the only deprogrammer to work with members of the religious group Branch Davidian prior to the Waco siege; some scholars later criticized his involvement with the siege.          Rick Alan Ross was born in 1952 in Cleveland, Ohio, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 1956. His mother worked for the Jewish Community Center and his father was a plumber. He was raised and went to school in Arizona with the exception of one year that he was sent to the Camden Military Academy in South Carolina after skipping too much school during high school. He graduated from Phoenix Union High School in 1971.           After high school, Ross worked for two years at a finance company and at a bank, but then got into legal trouble in his early 20s during a time period that he was in between jobs. In 1974, he pleaded guilty to trespassing after being charged for the attempted burglary of a vacant model home with a friend, and was sentenced to probation. In 1975, he was charged with grand theft, again with a friend, for embezzling from a jewelry shop where the friend worked. He returned everything, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 4 more years of probation, which was terminated early. While he was on probation, he worked for a cousin's car salvage business. During an interview with the ""New York Daily News"" in 2004, Ross said, ""I was young and foolish and made mistakes that I deeply regret. I did whatever the court required, completed my probation in 1979, and the guilty verdicts were vacated in 1983. I have gone on with my life and never again got in that kind of trouble.""          Ross became concerned about extremist organizations in 1982 when he learned that a fringe religious group had encouraged missionaries to become employees at his grandmother's nursing home where they were targeting elderly residents for conversion to Messianic Judaism. According to Ross, the missionaries were threatening Jewish residents, many of whom had survived persecution in Europe, that they'd burn in hell if they didn't convert. Outraged, Ross brought this to the attention of the home's director and of the local Jewish community and campaigned to have the group's activities stopped.          Following the incident at his grandmother's nursing home, Ross continued his involvement in the organized Jewish community and worked with the Jewish Federation of Greater Phoenix to write a brochure on the cult phenomenon in Arizona. This led the Union for Reform Judaism to appoint Ross to two national committees focused on cults and inter-religious affairs and he also volunteered as a lecturer and researcher for the denomination.          In 1983, Ross started working for Jewish Family and Children's Services (JFCS) in Phoenix as the coordinator for the Jewish Prisoners Program, which he founded. His work in the prison system covered social services for Jewish inmates, advocating for their religious rights, and providing education regarding hate groups. In addition, he chaired the Coalition of Jewish Prisoners Programs, the umbrella organization for an international group of human services agencies providing assistance to Jewish inmates and their families. He also served on the religious advisory committee for the Arizona Department of Corrections and was later elected as its chairman. From his work in the prison system, Ross discovered that prisoners were a prime target for cult groups and through his role on the religious advisory committee, he helped develop a policy on proselytizing to inmates. He also worked for Phoenix Bureau of Jewish Education, designing a curriculum and teaching about destructive cults.          In 1986 Ross left JFCS to become a full-time private consultant and deprogrammer, In this capacity, he worked with the Cult Awareness Network (CAN).          In 1989 the CBS television program ""48 Hours"" covered Ross's deprogramming of a 14-year-old boy, Aaron Paron, a member of the Potter's House Christian Fellowship. According to his mother, when she distanced herself from the church, Aaron began viewing her as ""possessed by the devil""; he became suicidal and ran away from home, refusing to leave the organization. Aaron's mother had made multiple calls to the police and, prior to filming, Potter's House entered into an agreement that they would not have contact with or harbor the minor, entice him away from his mother, attempt to influence his behavior, or take any action that would interfere with his mother's parental rights. The program focused on Ross's efforts to persuade the boy to view Potter's House as ""a destructive Bible-based group"" which took control of its members' lives. According to a review in ""The New York Times"", the 48-hour intervention apparently persuaded Aaron that his mother was not possessed by the Devil and that Potter's House was not what it seemed. In a closing scene filmed three weeks later, Aaron's psychologist assured his mother that Aaron was ""back in the land of the living now"".          In 1987, Ross deprogrammed two former members of the Branch Davidian group in upstate New York, and in 1988 began receiving calls about the Davidian group led by David Koresh in Waco, Texas. Ross was the only deprogrammer to work with Branch Davidian members prior to the 1993 siege at Waco. The CBS television network hired Ross as an on-scene analyst for their coverage of the Waco siege and he was consulted by the FBI as well.           Criticism of government agencies' involvement with Ross has come from Nancy Ammerman, a professor of sociology of religion, who cited FBI interview notes which stated Ross ""has a personal hatred for all religious cults"". She further stated the BATF and the FBI did rely on Ross when he recommended that agents ""attempt to publicly humiliate Koresh, hoping to drive a wedge between him and his followers"". Other scholars of religion also criticized Ross' involvement.          Ross faced unlawful imprisonment charges over a 1991 forcible deprogramming of United Pentecostal Church International member Jason Scott, whose mother was referred to Ross by the CAN. Ross was acquitted of these charges by the jury at trial.          Scott later filed a civil suit against Ross, two of his associates and CAN in federal court. In September 1995, a nine-member jury unanimously held the defendants liable for conspiracy to deprive Scott of his civil rights and religious liberties. In addition, the jury held that Ross and his associates (but not CAN) ""intentionally or recklessly acted in a way so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community."" The case resulted in an award of 875,000 in compensatory damages and punitive damages in the amount of 5,000,000 against Ross, 1,000,000 against CAN, and 250,000 against each of Ross's two other co-defendants. The case bankrupted the CAN, and a coalition of groups that were attacked by the CAN bought its assets, and ran a new version of the CAN which become active in religious freedom causes. According to Eugene Gallagher, the Scott case marked a watershed for non-traditional religions in North America.          Scott later reconciled with his mother, who had originally hired Ross to deprogram him. Scott terminated his lawyer, Kendrick Moxon, a prominent Scientologist attorney, and was persuaded by his mother to settle with Ross. Under the terms of the settlement, the two agreed that Ross would pay Scott 5,000 and provide 200 hours of his professional services.          According to the book ""American Countercultures"", Ross and others forwarded the notion that charismatic leaders were able to brainwash college-aged youths, and that such cases were in need of forcible removal from the cult environment and deprogramming. In a book that Ross self-published in 2014, he wrote that after the Scott case he stopped involuntary deprogramming work with adults, advising against such interventions with adults because of the risk of legal consequences.          Ross started a website with his archives in 1996. Launched under the name ""Rick A. Ross Institute for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups, and Movements"", it displayed material on controversial groups and movements and their leaders, including Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, as well as the Westboro Baptist Church on which Ross had been collecting data since 1993. Content from the website and Ross' opinion surrounding it has been cited in books such as Andrew Breitbart and Mark Ebner's ""Hollywood, Interrupted"" in which Ross is quoted as forwarding the notion that Hollywood and the entertainment industry is rife with connections to controversial groups, and that celebrities as role models may influence people by their endorsement of such groups. According to Ann E. Robertson the Institute ""is an unusual source of considerable information about rather obscure groups"".          In April 2004 NXIVM sued unsuccessfully against the Institute in ""NXIVM Corp. v. Ross Institute"", claiming copyright infringement. In June 2004 Landmark Education filed a 1 million lawsuit against the Institute, alleging that the Institute's online archives damaged Landmark Education's product. In December 2005, Landmark Education filed to dismiss its own lawsuit with prejudice, purportedly on the grounds of a material change in case law after the publication of an opinion in another case, ""Donato v. Moldow"", regarding the Communications Decency Act of 1996.          The website was renamed in 2013 as the ""Cult Education Institute for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements"", published under an educational nonprofit corporation of the same name.          By 2004, Ross had handled more than 350 deprogramming cases in various countries and testified as an expert witness in several court cases. He has also contributed to a number of books, including a foreword to Tim Madigan's ""See no Evil"" and a chapter to Roman Espejo's ""Cults: Opposing Viewpoints"".          In 2014 Ross self-published the book ""Cults Inside Out"". The book was published in China in 2015 by a Hong Kong publisher. It was also translated into Italian and published in Italy.","['1952 births', 'Living people', 'People from Cleveland, Ohio', 'American adoptees', 'American religious writers', 'Exit counselors', 'Critics of Falun Gong', 'Anti-cult organizations and individuals', 'Deprogrammers']"

49350587,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49350587,Chamba Rumal,"The Chamba Rumal or Chamba handkerchief is an embroidered handicraft that was once promoted under the patronage of the former rulers of Chamba kingdom. It is a common item of gift during marriages with detailed patterns in bright and pleasing colour schemes.          This product has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. On 22 January 2007, it was listed as ""Chamba Rumal"" under the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Classes 24 as Textile and Textile Goods, vide application number 79.          Earliest reported form of this rumal is the one made by Bebe Nanki, sister of Guru Nanak in the 16th century, which is now preserved in the Gurudwara at Hoshiarpur. The Victoria Albert Museum, London has a rumal which was gifted to the British in 1883 by Raja Gopal Singh and it has an embroidered scene of the Kurukshetra War of the epic Mahabharta. However, from the 17th century the women of the erstwhile princely state of Chamba (now part of Himachal Pradesh), including members of the royal family, indulged in embroidery of the rumals or handkerchiefs as a part of a marriage gifts or dowry to their daughters.          The handkerchiefs were made in geometrical shapes of square and rectangle using very fine hand made silk which was obtained from the Punjab or muslin cloth, a product of Bengal. Women created highly ornamental patterns using untwined thread made of silk produced in Sialkot (in Pakistan), Amritsar and Ludhiana. The embroidery technique adopted, called the ""dohara tanka"" or double satin stitch, created distinct identical patters on both faces of the fabric, which were attractive when viewed even from distance of 10 ft and more. The ""dohara tanka"" method is a heritage of Kashmir, which was adopted in Basohli and Chamba, but was improved upon by adopting themes from the special Mughal art of Chamba miniature paintings; this art form flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Following the downfall of the Mughal empire many expert artists of this craft migrated to the hill region of Himachal Pradesh. Raja Umed Singh of Chamba (1748–68) patronized the artists. These artists drew the outlines of the design on the fabric to be embroidered using fine charcoal and also suggested suitable colours to be adopted on the mythological themes of Krishna's raas-leela of the epic Mahabharata, and themes from Ramayana or scenes of marriage and game hunting to be embroidered; themes also included events from Gita Govinda, Bhagvat purana or only Radha-Krishna and Shiva-Parvati. Inspiration was also provided from the frescoes done in the Rang Mahal of Chamba. The women then executed the embroidery. In early 19th century, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled over the Punjab Hill States, Sikh style of painting also influenced the Chamba Rumal.          Following Indian Independence, this art work lost its royal patronage, and quality deteriorated due to commercialization by making many cheaper varieties such as table cloths, cushion covers, clothing, and even various machine made items to compete in the market with cheaper similar work from other regions.          To revive this art work, in the later part of 1970s, at the initiative of Usha Bhagat (a friend of Indira Gandhi), the DCC located the original designs of this art work from museums and collections, and women artists were then trained in this art work. As a result 16 designs have been recreated and quality restored.          Known as a ""needle wonder"" Chamba Rumal is now made in square and rectangular shapes. The materials used still consist of muslin, malmal, khaddar (a coarse fabric), fine charcoal or brush, and silk threads without knots. Using a double satin stitch for the embroidery, both faces of the cloth are concurrently stitched by a forward and backward technique to maintain uniformity of design on both faces of the rumal.

5731748,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5731748,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy,"Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a psychological therapy designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Its intent to address MDD specifically distinguishes MBCT from other mindfulness-based therapies such as mindfulness-based stress reduction which is applicable to a broad range of disorders, and mindfulness-based relapse prevention which is used to treat addiction.          MBCT uses traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression. Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation, focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them. This process is known as ""Decentering"" and aids in disengaging from self-criticism, rumination, and dysphoric mood that can arise when reacting to negative thinking patterns.          Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode. The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment. This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. It is theorized that this aspect of MBCT is responsible for the observed clinical outcomes.          Beyond its use in reducing depressive acuity, research additionally supports the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation upon reducing cravings for substances that people are addicted to. Addiction is known to involve the weakening of the prefrontal cortex that ordinarily allows for delaying of immediate gratification for longer term benefits by the limbic and paralimbic brain regions. Mindfulness meditation of smokers over a two-week period totaling five hours of meditation decreased smoking by about 60% and reduced their cravings, even for those smokers in the experiment who had no prior intentions to quit. Neuroimaging of those who practice mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex, a sign of greater self-control.          In 1991 Philip Barnard and John Teasdale created a multilevel theory of the mind called “Interacting Cognitive Subsystems,” (ICS). The ICS model is based on Barnard and Teasdale’s theory that the mind has multiple modes that are responsible for receiving and processing new information cognitively and emotionally. Barnard and Teasdale’s (1991) theory associates an individual’s vulnerability to depression with the degree to which he/she relies on only one of the modes of mind, inadvertently blocking the other modes. The two main modes of mind include the “doing” mode and “being” mode. The “doing” mode is also known as the driven mode. This mode is very goal-oriented and is triggered when the mind develops a discrepancy between how things are versus how the mind wishes things to be. The second main mode of mind is the “being” mode. “Being” mode, is not focused on achieving specific goals, instead the emphasis is on “accepting and allowing what is,” without any immediate pressure to change it. The central component of Barnard and Teasdale’s ICS is metacognitive awareness. Metacognitive awareness is the ability to experience negative thoughts and feelings as mental events that pass through the mind, rather than as a part of the self. Individuals with high metacognitive awareness are able to avoid depression and negative thought patterns more easily during stressful life situations, in comparison to individuals with low metacognitive awareness. Metacognitive awareness is regularly reflected through an individual’s ability to decenter. Decentering is the ability to perceive thoughts and feelings as both impermanent and objective occurrences in the mind.          Based on Barnard and Teasdale’s (1991) model, mental health is related to an individual’s ability to disengage from one mode or to easily move among the modes of mind. Therefore, individuals that are able to flexibly move between the modes of mind based on the conditions in the environment are in the most favorable state. The ICS model theorizes that the “being” mode is the most likely mode of mind that will lead to lasting emotional changes. Therefore, for prevention of relapse in depression, cognitive therapy must promote this mode. This led Teasdale to the creation of MBCT, which promotes the “being” mode.          This therapy was also created by Zindel Segal and Mark Williams, and was partially based on the mindfulness-based stress reduction program, developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Theories behind these mindfulness-based approaches to psychological issues function on the idea that being aware of things in the present, and not focusing on the past or the future, will allow the client to be more apt to deal with current stressors and distressing feelings with a flexible and accepting mindset, rather than avoiding, and, therefore, prolonging them.          The MBCT program is a group intervention that lasts eight weeks. During these eight weeks, there is a weekly course, which lasts two hours, and one day-long class after the fifth week. However, much of the practice is done outside of classes, where the participant uses guided meditations and attempts to cultivate mindfulness in their daily lives.          MBCT prioritizes learning how to pay attention or concentrate with purpose, in each moment and most importantly, without judgment. Through mindfulness, clients can recognize that holding onto some of these feelings is ineffective and mentally destructive. Mindfulness is also thought by Fulton et al. to be useful for the therapists as well during therapy sessions.          MBCT is an intervention program developed to specifically target vulnerability to depressive relapse. Throughout the program, patients learn mind management skills leading to heightened metacognitive awareness, acceptance of negative thought patterns and an ability to respond in skillful ways. During MBCT patients learn to decenter their negative thoughts and feelings, allowing the mind to move from an automatic thought pattern to conscious emotional processing. MBCT can be used as an alternative to maintenance antidepressant treatment, though it may be no more effective.          Although MBCT can be used as an alternative or adjunct therapy for depression, research shows that it is most effective with individuals who have a history of at least three or more past episodes of depression. Within that population, participants with life-event triggered depressive episodes were least receptive to MBCT. A 2016 meta-analysis found MBCT to be effective for preventing relapses of depressive episodes among those with depression, especially if they had more residual symptoms.          Research supports that MBCT results in increased self-reported mindfulness which suggests increased present-moment awareness, decentering, and acceptance, in addition to decreased maladaptive cognitive processes such as judgment, reactivity, rumination, and thought suppression.","['Cognitive therapy', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive behavioral therapy', 'Mindfulness (psychology)']"

17133537,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17133537,Blacker's Hill,"Blacker's Hill Chilcompton is an Iron Age hill fort South West of Radstock, Somerset, England. It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.          The hill fort is roughly rectangular and is a promentary type. It covers and originally had two ramparts and two ditches, but on the west and south sides it was defended by the steep drop. In some places the ramparts survive to a considerable height but on the north east side the inner rampart and ditch have been destroyed. There are three gaps but only that on the east seems to be original.          In 1999 a geophysical survey was carried out suggesting that Blackers Hill originated as a univallate structure and was then later modified, forming a developed hill fort.          Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated ""[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction"".","['Hill forts in Somerset', 'Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Mendip', 'History of Somerset', 'Iron Age sites in Somerset']"

His works include the concept albums, ""White Mansions"" and ""The Legend of Jesse James"". He produced and co-wrote ""The Ballad of Sally Rose"" with Emmylou Harris in 1985, and was married to Harris from 1985 to 1993.          Kennerley was born in Hoylake, Merseyside, North West England in 1948. In 1976, he was living in London and working in advertising when he first heard country music, the song ""Let's All Help the Cowboys Sing the Blues"" by Waylon Jennings. ""It really excited me,"" Kennerley recalls in his artist biography for Universal Music Group. ""I immediately hunted down every Waylon record I could find.""          Kennerley quit his job in advertising and allowed himself three months to develop his talents as a songwriter.          In 1972, Kennerley recorded an album with a rock band called 'Holy Roller' at Virgin record's newly opened Manor studio, with Tom Newman (Mike Oldfield, Tubular Bells etc.) and Philip Newell, and Newman subsequently sang all the songs on the demonstration tapes of the ""White Mansions"" album.          Kennerley's first project was ""White Mansions"", a 1978 concept album set in the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The project was picked up by A&M Records, with Glyn Johns producing. A number of notable artists recorded the music, including Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, Steve Cash of the Ozark Mountain Daredevils and Eric Clapton.          In 1980, a second concept album was released, ""The Legend of Jesse James"", which featured more notable artists, including Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Charlie Daniels, Albert Lee and Levon Helm.          Neither ""White Mansions"" nor ""Jesse James"" were commercially successful, but they did establish Kennerley as a serious songwriter. Among his early compositions was ""Born to Run"", which Emmylou Harris recorded in 1981 for her album, ""Cimarron"", and she continues to frequently perform the song in her concerts.          Kennerly continued to live in London while he wrote songs, but, in 1983, moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he started working with Harris on her semi-autobiographical concept album, ""The Ballad of Sally Rose"", co-writing and producing the album. Kennerley also collaborated with Harris on her albums ""Thirteen"" and ""Bluebird"", and writing the songs ""In My Dreams"" and ""Heartbreak Hill"". He married Harris in 1985, but the couple divorced in 1993.

Lanesfield lies within the Ancient Manor of Sedgley and was a rural village for many years until the growth of the Black Country's industries. Lanesfield's name originates from the Lane family who lived where the area now stands. Originally, Lanesfield was known as Lane's Field.          During the 19th century, many houses were built in Lanesfield, particularly in Wood Street, following the industrialisation of the eastern side of the Sedgley district. Many coal mines began to appear around Lanesfield. Two miners' cottages still exist in nearby Parkfields, and are now located on the A4123 Birmingham New Road, built in 1927.          In the 1890s, because it was situated in the eastern area of Sedgley, Lanesfield was separated when the Urban District of Coseley was formed, dividing the old Manor of Sedgley in two. The Birmingham New Road was cut through the area and many new houses (private and council) were built around it soon afterwards.          Following World War II, Coseley Urban District Council built hundreds of new homes in Lanesfield.          Today, the district is mainly a residential area.           Lanesfield, together with the surrounding areas of Parkfield and Ettingshall Park, was incorporated into the Borough of Wolverhampton in 1966 when the Urban District of Coseley was abolished and the former Manor of Sedgley split between authorities.          The first school to be built in Lanesfield was Wood Street School, an infant and junior school which was opened in 1879. The old school was demolished nearly 100 years later after the construction of the new Lanesfield Primary School, a larger building in nearby Newman Avenue, which opened on 30 April 1962. The old school was still being used until December 1968 to further accommodate children on the eastern side of the Birmingham New Road from numerous new houses built at the time.          In the early 1950s, another school was built in the western part of Lanesfield - Hill Avenue Primary School. This was for the children on the western side of the Birmingham New Road.          Lanesfield featured in local news on 25 May 2013, when around 60 members of the English Defence League including leader, Tommy Robinson, blocked the Birmingham New Road at its junction with Spring Road and Rookery Road following the murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich on 22 May 2013.",['Areas of Wolverhampton']

In his racing career, he ran in both Europe and North America, winning six races, most notably the Arlington Million as a five-year-old in 2000. Following his retirement, he showed promise as a stallion before dying at the age of eight.          Chester House was a dark bay horse bred by his owner, Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms breeding operation. He was sired by Mr. Prospector and out of the El Gran Senor mare Toussaud and was his dam's first foal. Toussaud later produced Belmont Stakes winner Empire Maker. Chester House was sent to be trained in England by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.          Chester House started his record in England with a win in his first outing. He then won the class B Rosehill at Doncaster, the class A Steventon at Newbury and the class A Huxley at Chester. He recorded his first group race in the Group Three Brigadier Gerard Stakes by five lengths. After about three showings in four more graded stakes in England, his connections entered him in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. Before the race, he was relocated to the United States to be trained by Robert Frankel. Chester House had no previous experience on dirt, stumbled at the start and was last for almost half of the race. He then made steady progress to finish fourth, less than three lengths behind the winner, Cat Thief. After the Classic, he remained in the United States to compete in turf races. After losing his first six starts, he won the Grade 1 Arlington Million by three lengths with Jerry Bailey riding. His connections then retired him and sent him to stud at the U.S. division of Juddmonte Farms.          Chester House showed promise as a sire of winners in a brief stud career. Most notable of his offspring is the champion mare Ventura, who won the 2008 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint and the 2009 Woodbine Mile against colts along with several other Grade 1 wins. Ventura earned over $2 million. Chester House had a second Breeders’ Cup winner in the colt Muhannak, who won the 2008 Breeders’ Cup Marathon and was a Grade 3 winner in Ireland. Chester House's other winners included grade 1 winner Divine Park; the multiple grade 2 winner Spring House (who raced for 5 seasons); grade 2 winner Warning Zone; and grade 3 winner Stonehouse, along with many more minor stakes winners. Standing at $25,000 for a guaranteed live foal, Chester House offered the Mr. Prospector blood line at a much lower price than similar stallions like Kingmambo or Fusaichi Pegasus.          In May 2003, Chester House’s handlers noticed that he wasn’t doing well. A vet visit showed he was anaemic and had contracted pneumonia. Further test showed these were secondary sicknesses as he had developed a type of cancer called Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Chemotherapy began at once in order to save his life, but the illness progressed so rapidly that Juddmonte Farms managers decided to euthanise the horse on June 28, 2003.","['Thoroughbred racehorses', '1995 racehorse births', '2003 racehorse deaths', 'Thoroughbred family 6-d']"

The act started as a folk-rock trio a year prior to the formation of the 5-piece indie-rock band ""Glass House Point"" featuring Dylan Graham on guitar and vocals, Ian Campbell on bass and Nick Wegman on banjo. At the time, Campbell, Wegman and Graham were freshmen in high school. Glass House Point was officially formed in September 2013 with the addition of drums and Dylan Methot on the electric guitar and mandolin.          Wegman later left the band due to artistic differences and was replaced by Noah Feldman (violin/piano). Jansen Valk (drums) officially joined the indie-rock act in January of 2016.           In late 2015, Glass House Point started a partnership with Hooligans Movement clothing company, becoming one of their first sponsored artists. The two have been known to affiliate at shows and events across Florida.          Glass House Point recorded their debut EP, ""Love Lives in Dark Places"", at Sound House Studios with owner/audio engineer Jonathon Gautier in downtown Lakeland, Florida. The band released their first single off the EP, ""Hungry Eyes,"" in October of 2015 and followed up shortly thereafter with the subsequent single release of ""Heaven"" in November. The 6-track EP was officially released in full on January 12th, 2016 on the band's own independent record label.          Glass House Point has become notorious in Florida for the band's ability to move and engage crowds. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Glass House Point began a local touring circuit, playing packed shows at many of Florida's largest and most renowned venues-- Backbooth, The Social, The Polk Theatre, The State Theatre, and The Orpheum being a few.

42235053,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42235053,Gideon Toury,"Gideon Toury () (born 1942) is an Israeli translation scholar and professor of Poetics, Comparative Literature and Translation Studies at Tel Aviv University, where he holds the M. Bernstein Chair of Translation Theory. Gideon Toury is a pioneer of Descriptive Translation Studies.          Gideon Toury was born in Haifa, the first child of the historian Jacob Toury (1915–2004) and his wife Eve. He completed high school at the Reali School in Haifa in 1960. After high-school, he did his military service in the Nahal Brigade and the paratroopers and as part of his training was sent to a kibbutz, to help out with the farming. He lived there for six years, and he ended up editing the kibbutz journal and organizing cultural events. This experience helped him obtaining a position in a children's journal, where he did his first translations, and later as the editor of the Hebrew version of ""Popular Photography"".          He graduated with honors in Hebrew language and Literature at Tel Aviv University in 1970, and completed a PhD Literary Theory at the same university in 1977 on the topic of ""Translational Norms and Literary Translation into Hebrew, 1930-1945"". In 1980 he won the Hans Christian Andersen Award for his translation into Hebrew of C.S. Lewis ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". He was the first chair professor in CETRA, the research program in Translation Studies created by Jose Lambert in 1989. In 1999, he was awarded honorary membership of the UNESCO Chair of Translation Studies at Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Middlesex University, London.          From 1970 to 1983, he worked with Benjamin Harshav, Itamar Even-Zohar and Menachem Perry in the journal ""Literature"" and in 1989 he founded ""Target, International Journal of Translation Studies"" and has been general editor since. He is also General Editor of the ""Benjamins Translation Library"". He was also a member of the boards of ""The Translator"" and the ""Translation Studies Abstracts"" until he was ""unappointed"" following the decision of Mona Baker to boycott Israelite academia.          His main research is on the theory of translation and descriptive translation studies, with emphasis on the history of the Hebrew translation of the Bible to the present.          According to Toury, there are prescriptive and descriptive studies. Prescriptive approaches aim to formulate rules that should be followed by anyone who produces a text of a given type. They are focused on finding the most optimal or correct solutions. Descriptive approaches are about looking into existing texts and describing the rules they seem to follow.           He came up with the term ""translation norms"", as hidden rules followed by the majority discovered by descriptive observation of actual translation. They are not understood as prescriptive rules but as norms specific to a context. Therefore, norms change with time and culture, so translation re-visits the same problem over and over again.           He has published three books, a number of edited volumes and numerous articles, in both English and Hebrew, in the fields of translation theory and comparative literature. His articles have also appeared in translation in many other languages, and he is himself an active translator too (with about 30 books and many articles to his credit).","['1942 births', 'People from Tel Aviv', 'Tel Aviv University alumni', 'Israeli linguists', 'Translation scholars', 'Living people']"

34540507,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34540507,SS Aleutian,"SS ""Aleutian "" was a passenger ship in North American coastal service. Built in 1899 for the Ward Line as ""SS Havana"", she would later serve the building of the Panama Canal as ""SS Panama"" and ultimately enter Alaska service as ""SS Aleutian"".          In 1898 the Ward Line ordered two ships from William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company in Philadelphia as part of a modernization plan in response to increased passenger and freight demand. The new passenger ship ""SS Havana"" was delivered in 1899 and briefly saw military transport service (Official Number 96435) during the Spanish American War moving two infantry units from Havana, Havana, Cuba to Savannah, Georgia. She soon joined the company’s steamers linking New York with Nassau, Havana, and Mexican Gulf ports.          ""Havana"" was sold to the Panama Railroad Steamship Company on behalf of the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1905. She was renamed ""SS Panama"" and would serve a crucial role in the construction of the Panama Canal. The steamship company was already running connecting service with New York and San Francisco. It also ran a Central American line of steamships linking Nicaragua, Costa Rica, San Salvador, and Guatemala to Panama City. The shipping service was greatly expanded as canal construction began. The line's heyday was during the construction period; once the canal was finished in 1914 the service shifted to the business of supporting the maintenance and operation of the canal and its supporting infrastructure, including the railroad.          In February 1927 ""Panama"" was sold to the Alaska Steamship Company and transferred to Pacific coastal service. Renamed ""SS Aleutian"" after the volcanic islands along the southwest Alaska coastline, the vessel received a complete overhaul and refit in Seattle. At this time she likely would have been converted from a coal to an oil fired vessel. Contemporary reports described her as palatial and she became the steamship company's flagship. She entered the company’s Alaska service carrying freight, passengers and mail service from Seattle, Washington.          On 26 May 1929 ""Aleutian"" was steaming into Uyak Bay. The weather was clear with good visibility. ""Aleutian"" suddenly shook throughout her hull. She had struck a submerged pinnacle rock that had torn into her. The ship sank just seven minutes after impact. All but one person, a crew member, made it off and survived.          ""Aleutian"" was thought to have sunk in very deep water and no salvage had been attempted. In 1998 shipwreck historian Steve Lloyd researched the testimony from the Marine Board of Inquiry hearing that had been conducted after the sinking of Aleutian. Reconstructing testimony given by ""Aleutian's"" officers he estimated the course of the ship just before the pinnacle rock had inflicted its mortal blow. In 2002 he began a side-scan sonar and a magnetometer search of the sea floor beginning at the rock that had sunk the ship. (The rock was later marked with a navigation aid and named ""Aleutian Rock"" to honor the deceased crew member.) On 14 August 2002 the searchers found a metallic target on the seabed. The discovery was confirmed when a diver descended for an inspection. On the bottom, still upright, lay ""Aleutian"". Her wreck is located just off the southern tip of Amook Island, about midway down the length of Uyak Bay at Kodiak Island.           In 2003 Lloyd sought salvage rights to the wreck. ""The cargo's still in the hold. The furniture is still in the stateroom ... spittoons still in the gentlemen's smoking room…Portions of the superstructure have collapsed, and almost all the wood is gone. But sections of the deck were steel and are still there."" In 2004 the wreck site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.           In December 2005 the state of Alaska and the discoverer’s exploration company reached a settlement that would allow artifact recovery in compliance with state’s Office of History and Archeology and environmental regulations. ""Aleutian"" is slowly deteriorating from the effects of saltwater corrosion and time. Despite the ship’s rapid sinking and time underwater she is nonetheless remarkably intact. The depth, current, and low visibility of her resting place makes her accessible only to experienced deep-wreck divers with advanced training and certification.","['1899 ships', 'Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska', 'Maritime incidents in 1929', 'Passenger ships of the United States', 'Ships of the Ward Line', 'Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska', 'National Register of Historic Places in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska']"

8157399,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8157399,David Harris (American football),"David Charles Harris (born January 21, 1984) is an American football inside linebacker for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Michigan. Harris was selected in the second round of the 2007 NFL Draft by the Jets.          Harris attended Ottawa Hills High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan where he excelled at football. At linebacker, he set a school record with 158 tackles as a junior, and earned all-state honors from the ""Detroit Free Press"" as a senior, and he also contributed as a fullback.          Harris also participated in track and field, and this combination of size and speed led him to become one of the states top prospects.          Harris received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Michigan, where he played for the Michigan Wolverines football team. However, he was forced to redshirt as a freshman due to a knee injury which nearly derailed his career. It took nearly two years for Harris to fully recover, and he only played sparingly as a redshirt freshman and sophomore.          Not until his junior year did Harris become a full-time starter. He began to show signs of a future in the NFL when he led the Wolverines in 2005 with 88 tackles, and 103 tackles as a senior. In 2006, he earned All-Big Ten Conference honors, was Wolverines co-MVP with Mike Hart, and was a second team All-America selection by the Associated Press, ""Sports Illustrated"", and Rivals.com.          Harris was projected to go anywhere from the late-second round to the fourth round prior to the 2007 NFL Draft. However, he impressed scouts when he ran a 4.59 40 yard dash at the NFL Combine. He drew interest from the New York Jets, due partially to new linebackers coach Jim Herrmann who had previously been defensive coordinator for Harris' Michigan Wolverines.          Harris was drafted in the 2nd round (47th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft by the New York Jets. The Jets sent their 2nd, 3rd, and 6th picks that year to the Green Bay Packers in exchange for the Packers 2nd rounder to select Harris.          On Sunday, October 28, 2007, Harris recorded his first NFL start, making 17 tackles (10 solo) and 1 sack in against the Buffalo Bills. Harris started in place of injured LB Jonathan Vilma who was placed on injured reserve after a knee injury. Harris made 24 tackles (20 solo) the following week against the Washington Redskins. In 2007, Harris was named NFL’s Defensive Rookie of the Month for November 2007.          For the 2007 NFL season, Harris had 127 tackles, 5 sacks, and two forced fumbles despite only starting 9 games, and earned various all-rookie honors.          In late February, the Jets traded MLB Jonathan Vilma to the New Orleans Saints, and Harris was named the starter at Inside linebacker for the 2008 season. Although an injury shortened season limited Harris to just 11 games, he still posted 87 tackles and 1 sack.          Against the Houston Texans in the first week of the season, Harris finished with 11 tackles (six solo), one sack, and a deflected pass as the defense pitched a shutout. Harris also won AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his play. In week three, as his team was only up seven points, he intercepted a Kerry Collins pass, and then followed that drive by sacking him on first down during the Tennessee Titans next series. Harris himself had 12 tackles, (ten solo). During the Jets' week six game against the Buffalo Bills, Harris recorded 17 tackles. In week 11 against division rivals, Harris recorded 13 tackles (ten solo) as he earned defensive play caller for the Jets that week.          Harris finished his season as the leading tackler on football's number one defense with 127 tackles. He also chipped in with five and a half sacks and two interceptions. In addition, he made second team all-pro.          Harris led the Jets into the AFC Championship for the first time since 1998 until losing to the Indianapolis Colts.          On January 16, 2011, Harris recorded his first career postseason interception in which he returned it for 58 yards against the New England Patriots in the AFC Divisional Round. Jets won 28-21 to advance to their second straight AFC Championship game. It was Tom Brady's first Interception in 11 games (340 pass attempts without an interception). He led the Jets into the AFC Championship for the 2nd year in a row but dropped 19-24 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.          Harris recorded 86 tackles, 5 sacks along with 4 interceptions in the 2011 season. On November 9, 2011, Harris was named AFC’s Defensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Buffalo Bills.          Harris recorded 123 combined tackles, 3 sacks, 3 passes defended and one forced fumble.          Harris finished the season with 124 combined tackles, 2 sacks, one passes defended and one forced fumble.          Harris finished the season with 123 combined tackles along with five and half sacks and two forced fumbles.          On March 6, 2015, the Jets re-signed Harris to a three-year, $21.5 million contract with $15 million guaranteed. In 16 starts, he made 108 tackles with 4.5 sacks, 4 passes defended, and 2 forced fumbles.          He currently resides in Parsippany, New Jersey.

The Taj Mahal in Agra was constructed by her husband as her final resting place.          She was born as Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra into a family of Persian nobility as a daughter of Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan, making her a niece and later, a stepdaughter-in-law of Empress Nur Jehan, the wife of the emperor Jahangir. Arjumand Banu Begum was married at the age of 19, on 10 May 1613, to Prince Khurram, later known as Emperor Shah Jahan, who conferred upon her the title ""Mumtaz Mahal"". Although betrothed to Shah Jahan in 1607, she ultimately became his 4th wife in 1612 and was his one of the favourites. She died in Burhanpur in the Deccan (now in Madhya Pradesh) during the birth of their fourteenth child, a daughter named Gauhara Begum.          Mumtaz Mahal mothered fourteen children by Shah Jahan, including Aurangzeb; the Imperial Prince Dara Shikoh, the heir apparent anointed by Shah Jahan, who temporarily succeeded Shah Jahan until deposed by his brother Aurangzeb; and Jahanara Begum, the Imperial Princess.          Arjumand Banu Begum was born in Agra in a family of Persian nobility as a daughter of Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan, making her a niece (and later daughter-in-law) of Empress Nur Jehan, the wife of the emperor Jahangir. Her older sister, Parwar Khanum, married Sheikh Farid, the son of Nawab Qutubuddin Koka, the governor of Badaun who was also the emperor Jahangir's foster brother. Empress Mumtaz was religiously a Shia Muslim.          In 1607 AD (1016 AH), Prince Khurram, also known as Shah Jahan, was betrothed to Arjumand Banu Begum who was just 14 years          old at the time, but would nonetheless become the unquestioned love of his life. They would, however, have to wait five years before they were married in 1612 AD (1021 AH), on a date selected by the court astrologers as most conducive to ensuring a happy marriage. After their wedding celebrations, Khurram ""finding her in appearance and character elect among all the women of the time"", gave her the title ""Mumtaz Mahal"" Begum (Chosen One of the Palace). 18 AH). The intervening years had seen Khurram take two other wives. But by all accounts however, Khurram was so taken with Mumtaz that he showed little interest in exercising his polygamous rights with the two earlier wives, other than dutifully siring a child with each. According to the official court chronicler, Motamid Khan (as recorded in his Iqbal Namah-e-Jahangiri), the relationship with his other wives ""had nothing more than the status of marriage. The intimacy, deep affection, attention and favour which His Majesty had for the Cradle of Excellence (Mumtaz) exceeded by a thousand times what he felt for any other."" Therefore,Shah Jahan bestowed Mumtaj with luxuries that no other queen was given. For example, no other queen's residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own.          Mumtaz Mahal had a deep and loving marriage with Shah Jahan. Even during her lifetime, poets would extol her beauty, grace, and compassion. She was Shah Jahan's trusted companion, travelling with him all over the Mughal Empire. His trust in her was so great that he even gave her his imperial seal, the Muhr Uzah. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jehan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign. A great influence on him, apparently often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra.          Despite her frequent pregnancies, Mumtaz travelled with Shah Jahan's entourage throughout his earlier military campaigns and the subsequent rebellion against his father. She was his constant companion and trusted confidant, leading court historians to go to unheard lengths to document the intimate and erotic relationship the couple enjoyed. In their nineteen years of marriage, they had fourteen children together, seven of whom died at birth or at a very young age.          When Shah Jahan travelled from Balapur Fort to Burhanpur, mother of Mirza Azam and elder daughter of Shahzada Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi, alias Shah Nawaz Khan of the Safavid dynasty, the princess Dilras Banu Begum, wife of Aurangzeb along with Mumtaz and cousin/brother Shah Beg Khan, along with military personnel - stayed three nights near Argaon at Hiwarkhed, before the birth of their fourteenth child.          Mumtaz Mahal died in Burhanpur in 1631 AD (1040 AH) while giving birth to her fourteenth child. She had been accompanying her husband while he was fighting a campaign in the Deccan Plateau. Her body was temporarily buried at Burhanpur in a walled pleasure garden known as Zainabad originally constructed by Shah Jahan's uncle Daniyal on the bank of the Tapti River. The contemporary court chroniclers paid an unusual amount of attention to Mumtaz Mahal's death and Shah Jahan's grief at her demise. In the immediate aftermath of his bereavement, the emperor was reportedly inconsolable. Apparently after her death, Shah Jahan went into secluded mourning for a year. When he appeared again, his hair had turned white, his back was bent, and his face worn. Shah Jahan's eldest daughter, Jahanara Begum, gradually brought him out of grief and took the place of Mumtaz at court.          Her personal fortune (valued at 10,000,000 rupees) was divided by Shah Jahan between Jahanara Begum, who received half and the rest of her surviving children. Burhanpur was never intended by her husband as his wife's final resting spot. As a result, her body was disinterred in December 1631 and transported in a golden casket escorted by her son Shah Shuja and the head lady in waiting of the deceased Empress back to Agra. There it was interred in a small building on the banks of the Yamuna River. Shah Jahan stayed behind in Burhanpur to conclude the military campaign that had originally brought him to the region. While there, he began planning the design and construction of a suitable mausoleum and funerary garden in Agra for his wife. It was a task that would take more than 22 years to complete: the Taj Mahal.          A crater was named in her honour on asteroid 433 Eros, along with another one after her husband.","['1593 births', '1631 deaths', 'Deaths in childbirth', 'Indian female royalty', 'Indian Muslims', 'Indian Shia Muslims', 'Islam and women', 'Mughal nobility', 'People from Agra', 'Persian women', 'Royal consorts', 'Taj Mahal', 'Women of the Mughal Empire', 'Indian queen consorts']"

28106035,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28106035,Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad,"Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad (1881–1979) was a Tunisian theologian, journalist and intellectual. In 1931 he published ""Mourning on Haddad's Woman"" (ﺍﻟﺤﺪﺍﺩ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺍﻣﺮأﺓ ﺍﻟﺤﺪﺍﺩ) objecting to the expanded rights for women which were advocated by Tahar Haddad in his book ""Our Women in the Sharia and Society"" published one year earlier.          Born in the Medina of Tunis near the Tourbet El Bey, Mohamed Salah was the son of the Hanafi Bach-mufti, Sheikh H'mida Ben Mrad, a specialist in rhetoric and the elder brother of the sheikhs Neji (who served as qadi and mufti) and Brahim Ben Mrad (who served as imam,teacher at the Zaytuna,judge at the Tunis tribunal). He came from a family of Tunis scholars and intellectuals of Ottoman origin, from Turkey. Dating back to the seventeenth century, his grandfather Murad Khodja was part of the military army of Sinan Pasha, who participated in the battle of La Goulette against the army of Charles V in 1574.           He completed his studies at the Zaytuna and left in 1900.          Ben Mrad, a book entitled: Mourning Haddad's Women (الحداد على امرأة الحداد), was published in 193, where he rejects the ideas of Tahar Haddad on the Status of Women in Tunisia, based on the scriptural texts of the Koran. The book follows an outcry from scholars of the court of Sharia and much of the population were in favor of the new ideas of Haddad. He defends the idea of wearing ""sefseri"" by Tunisian women which he finds is not a sign of religious identification, but a more traditional dress akin to a national uniform that was shared by all social groups. He also rejects the idea that social reforms can be accomplished without the time necessary for their understanding and assimilation by a colonized population still largely illiterate. According to him, the emancipation of Tunisian women must come first through instruction and education . He acknowledged however that some ideas of Haddad are not opposed to the Sharia on the Status of Women. This was done in the journal that he founded in 1937 - Shams al-Islam (The sun of Islam).          He was appointed as the Sheikh el Islam in the kingdom by Moncef Bey in 1942. After the removal of the latter, on the occasion of the inauguration of the new Bey Lamine by General Alphonse Juin, he insisted, in his speech to the king, on his role as guarantor of the monarchy and the Husseinite throne, suggesting that there is a void left by Moncef Bey in the heart of Tunisians. In 1944 he helped set up the reform commission's Zaytuna University, chaired by Sheikh Mohammed and President Tahar Ben Achour, responding to the wishes of Tunisian intellectuals and zeytounien students, concerned about the future of the oldest university in the Arab-Muslim world. Under pressure from the Resident General of France in Tunisia Charles Mast, Sheikh Ben Mrad was dismissed from his post in 1946, because of his political commitment to nationalist leaders of the Neo-Destour imprisoned and exiled, and in favor of the union movement of the General Union of Tunisian Workers - Farhat Hached.          His daughter, Bchira Ben Mrad, founded in 1937, the first women's organization: Tunisian Union of Muslim women in Tunisia, with the support of her father and sisters, getting numerous articles published in the journal of her father. Contrary to what some thought, the sheikh gave a modern education to his daughters that closely mingled with the intellectual and cultural life in Tunis.","['Tunisian people of Turkish descent', 'Tunisian theologians', 'Tunisian journalists', 'Tunisian writers', '1909 births', '1970 deaths', 'Writers from Tunis']"
21812901,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21812901,Philadelphia (band),"Philadelphia was a Christian metal band from Shreveport, Louisiana. The ""Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music"" describes them as having been unjustly condemned by ""the slings and arrows of fundamentalist bigotry"" for their musical style and lyrics. Their name is a reference to the church of Philadelphia in Revelation 3 verses 7-10.          Musically, the band was characterized as being ""Harder than Rez and more intense than Daniel Band and Barnabas.""          The band was originally a general market band called Survivor. After breaking up in 1981, the members found Christianity through independent experiences. They reunited in 1982 as a Christian band and produced their first LP, ""Tell The Truth"" in 1984. Their styling was not well received by the entire Christian community, for which metal was still a fringe sound. While one publication found that the band emphasized ""ministry and outreach through their direct and hard hitting lyrics,"" others saw the same as inappropriately descriptive and judgmental. For their lyrics and style the band garnered the scorn of some national religious media.          In 1985 the band appeared at Cornerstone and released a second album entitled ""Search and Destroy"". Its lyrics were controversial as well, as the release tackled social issues such as child abuse, drug abuse and runaways through the eyes of a character named Bobby. One reviewer called the result an ""overly serious tone and melodramatic feel."" Brian Clark responded to the bands critics, stating that ""Bobby is part and parcel of all these American tragedies, and Jesus is shown to be real and relevant.""          A third project entitled ""Warlord"" was planned, and tracks recorded, but never released. Some tracks from the project, along with a few newly recorded ones, were rereleased by M8 Records along with their studio albums in 2000.          Their third album, ""Warlord"", was released in 2016, thirty years later, on the band's own label, Philly Music. Members are the original core trio, Brian Martini on drums, Phil Scholling on guitars and Brian 'Wulfie' Clark on bass and vocals. The title track is the same one written 30 years ago, recorded in the studio for the first time, with the balance of the release all new material written by Scholling and Clark.","['American Christian metal musical groups', 'Heavy metal musical groups from Louisiana']"

Founded by Ernest T. Weir in 1909 as Weirton Steel, the company later became part of the National Steel Corporation. In 1983, employees agreed to purchase the operation from National Steel and form into an employee-owned corporation. In the last years of its life, Weirton withered away and filed for bankruptcy protection on May 19, 2003. The International Steel Group purchased Weirton and formed ISG Weirton Inc. in 2004.           ISG was sold to Mittal Steel, which currently is in the process of downsizing the mill.          Weirton Steel Corporation was an integrated steel mill founded in 1909 by Ernest T. Weir, who built Weirton Steel into one of the world's leading steel producers. In 1905 Weir and his partner, James Phillips, bought a tin mill in Clarksburg, West Virginia. In 1909, the partners successfully relocated and expanded the operation in what was then Hollidays Cove, West Virginia. They chose Hollidays Cove because of its abundant water supply. The water was much needed for steel production, and offered ready access to major steel markets.          In 1929, Weir merged Weirton Steel with Detroit's Michigan Steel and Cleveland's M. A. Hanna Company to form National Steel Corporation. National Steel quickly took a place among the nation's largest steel producers.          However, toward the end of the century Weirton Steel had fallen on hard times. In the early 1980s it was purchased from National Steel by the employees, thus at that time, making it the world's largest Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).          This was not enough to ensure the long-term viability of the company. It finally went bankrupt in the early 21st century just short of its 100th birthday. By court order, the assets were auctioned with most being acquired by ISG. ISG then formed a new division called ISG Weirton Steel. On April 5, 2005, ISG completed a merger with Mittal Steel. Then again in 2006, Mittal Steel completed a merger with Arcelor thus resulting in a new company known as Arcelor Mittal.","['ArcelorMittal', 'Companies established in 1909', 'Steel companies of the United States']"

He played as a centre half or left half.          Ormiston was born in Peebles, Scotland. He played non-league football in England for Hebburn Argyle, before joining Football League Second Division club Lincoln City in 1907. The club finished bottom of the division in 1908, and failed to gain re-election to the League. Ormiston helped Lincoln win their second Midland League title in 1908–09, and then followed former Lincoln manager David Calderhead to First Division club Chelsea. He played just over 100 matches in senior competition over five years, and made a solid contribution to Chelsea's return to the First Division in 1912, but his career with the club effectively ended in April 1914 when he suffered a serious ankle injury in a match at Bradford City.          He guested for former club Lincoln during the war, and signed for them when competitive football resumed in 1919. On the opening day of the 1919–20 season, as Lincoln earned an unexpected draw against West Ham United, who were playing their first match after joining the Football League from the Southern League, Ormiston's experience made him stand out: He played his last game for Lincoln in December 1919, and returned to Scotland, where he appeared for Peebles Rovers.

1491853,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1491853,Chris Eagles,"Christopher Mark ""Chris"" Eagles (born 19 November 1985) is an English footballer who last played for Bury. Primarily a winger, he can also play as an attacking midfielder. After coming through the youth system at Watford, he began his professional career with Manchester United, but was unable to break into the first team. He had two loan spells back at Watford, as well as with Sheffield Wednesday and Dutch club N.E.C., before a permanent move to Burnley in 2008. He has also played for Bolton Wanderers, Blackpool, Charlton Athletic and Bury.          Eagles was born in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, and was a season ticket holder at Tottenham Hotspur, whom he went to see with his family. Originally coming through the youth system at Watford, Eagles left when he was 14 to join the Manchester United academy. The compensation owed to Watford for this move would later form part of the package which took Danny Webber in the opposite direction.          Eagles made his first-team debut for Manchester United on 28 October 2003 as a second-half substitute for Kieran Richardson in an extra-time win away to Leeds United in the League Cup. He played once more that season, this time as a substitute for Cristiano Ronaldo as United lost 2–0 away to West Bromwich Albion in a League Cup Fourth Round tie.          On 21 December 2006, Eagles decided to take the option of returning to Manchester United after struggling to get many games on loan at Dutch Eredivisie side N.E.C. He only made 11 appearances for N.E.C., with the majority coming as a substitute. On 13 March 2007, Eagles featured in the second half for United in an exhibition match at Old Trafford against Marcello Lippi's Europe XI.          On 28 April 2007, Eagles scored his first senior goal for United in a 4–2 Premier League win over Everton. After coming on as a second-half substitute, he scored a 93rd-minute goal to put the result beyond doubt and putting Manchester United five points clear in their race for the Premier League title. On 20 July 2007, during Manchester United's tour of Asia, he scored in a friendly match against FC Seoul. He also scored a spectacular 35-yard volley in a friendly match against Shenzhen FC four days later, bringing his total for the tour to three goals in five games. Eagles scored another pre-season goal the following year, netting United's equaliser against Kaizer Chiefs to earn a 1–1 draw. He also started in the pre-season game against Portsmouth in Nigeria, scoring United's opening goal.          Eagles was loaned to Watford on 21 January 2005, for whom he made 13 appearances and scored one goal (against Gillingham). He was also loaned to Sheffield Wednesday for the first half of the 2005–06 season. He scored his first goal for Sheffield Wednesday in their derby match against Leeds. He ended his loan spell with a total of three goals for Wednesday.          On 6 January 2006, Eagles was again loaned to Watford, making his debut against his future employers Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup, with the Hornets going down 3–0. In his first league appearance for Watford against Stoke City, he scored the only goal of the match for Watford. His winning goal in the 1–0 away win at Brighton & Hove Albion on 18 February from 50 yards (almost the halfway line) – reminiscent of David Beckham's goal for Manchester United against Wimbledon a decade earlier – won him the club's goal of the season award. He also scored the first goal in the 4–1 thrashing away at Sheffield United, and David Unsworth was sent off for elbowing him. Having played almost every game for the Hornets since his loan move, Eagles was put on the bench for the play-off games.          On 31 August 2006, Eagles agreed to spend four months on loan at Dutch outfit N.E.C., in order to gain more experience.          On 29 July 2008, Eagles signed for Burnley on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Manager Owen Coyle said, ""He can play as a striker, or behind the striker or wide or as a central midfielder. He gives you a host of variations, but outwith that he's a talented footballer and that's what we want – young exciting talents to complement the quality we already have."" Eagles made his league debut for Burnley on 9 August 2008 in a 4–1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday. On 27 September 2008, he scored his first goal for Burnley in a 3–1 victory over rivals Preston North End, scoring in the 95th minute.          In July 2010, the Clarets accepted a bid from Scottish champions Rangers to buy Eagles, but the player was unable to agree terms with the Scottish club and remained in England. He went on to score 15 goals in 48 appearances in his final season with Burnley.          On 29 July 2011, Eagles and his Burnley team-mate Tyrone Mears joined Bolton Wanderers on three-year contract for a joint fee in the region of £3 million, linking up with their ex-manager Owen Coyle for a second time in their careers. He made his debut in a 4–0 away win at Queens Park Rangers on 13 August, where he created an assist for the second goal put in his own net by Danny Gabbidon. On 20 September, he scored his first goal for Bolton, from 25 yards, in the League Cup Third Round 2–0 away win against Aston Villa. His first League goal for Bolton came on 15 October in a 3–1 win away to Wigan Athletic, where he also assisted the first goal, an own goal by Gary Caldwell. He also scored a brace in the 5–0 home win against Stoke City on 6 November. He found himself out of the starting line-up for a few games for a while due to Tuncay Şanlı being in form, but he came back to the starting line-up on 21 April 2012, where he scored in a 1–1 draw at home to Swansea City, and kept his place the following game, in the 2–1 away win to Aston Villa, where he provided the assist for the winning goal from David N'Gog. At the end of the season, Bolton were relegated to the Championship.          Eagles became a key player for Bolton upon their return to the Championship and was Bolton's top scorer from early in the season, scoring six times in the first few months against Derby County, Nottingham Forest, Hull City, Birmingham City, Millwall and Bristol City but despite being named Player of the Month by the fans for August, September and October of the new season, Bolton were in the bottom half of the table. Following Owen Coyle's sacking Dougie Freedman said that he wanted to base his team around Eagles. In 2013 Bolton's fortunes changed as they went from 20th to 6th within two months. However, come the end of the season they finished seventh meaning that they did not make the play-off places.          Eagles finished the season as Bolton's top goalscorer with twelve goals, and also created the most number of goals, with twelve assists. His form in April earned him a nomination for the Football League Championship Player of the Month.          At the end of the 2013–14 season he was released by the club along with Zat Knight, Tyrone Mears and Jay Lynch. Eagles played only 18 times in his last season at the club.          Shortly after his release from Bolton, he explained that he was disappointed at aspects of his departure, but maintained an affection for both the club's supporters and the town.          On 18 November 2014, Eagles joined Blackpool on a short term contract until January 2015. After leaving Blackpool, Eagles signed for Charlton Athletic on 19 February 2015 on a free transfer until the end of the 2014–15 season. Eagles was released at the end of his contract and subsequently joined Football League One club Bury in October 2015 on a contract until the end of the season.          In July 2014, Eagles was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Bolton for his services to sport.","['1985 births', 'Association football wingers', 'Blackpool F.C. players', 'Bolton Wanderers F.C. players', 'Burnley F.C. players', 'Charlton Athletic F.C. players', 'English expatriate footballers', 'English footballers', 'Eredivisie players', 'Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands', 'Footballers from Hertfordshire', 'People from Hemel Hempstead', 'Living people', 'Manchester United F.C. players', 'NEC Nijmegen players', 'People associated with the University of Bolton', 'Premier League players', 'Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players', 'The Football League players', 'Watford F.C. players']"
10909234,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10909234,List of birds of Saint Lucia,"This is a list of the bird species recorded in Saint Lucia. The avifauna of Saint Lucia include a total of 177 species, of which seven are endemic, one has been introduced by humans and 107 are rare or accidental. Six species are globally threatened.          This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ""The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World"", 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total count for Saint Lucia.          The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.          Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae          Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.          Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae          The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized ""true petrels"", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.          Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae          Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae          The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae          Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae          Darters are often called ""snake-birds"" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae          Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.          Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae          Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes.          Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae          The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.          Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae          Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are strong fliers and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers.          Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae          Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.          Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae          Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.          Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae          The Pandionidae family contains only one species, the osprey. The osprey is a medium-large raptor which is a specialist fish-eater with a worldwide distribution.          Order: AcciptriformesFamily: Accipitridae          Accipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures. These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen eyesight.          Order: FalconiformesFamily: Falconidae          Falconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.          Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae          Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

Order: PasseriformesFamily: Fringillidae          Finches are seed-eating passerine birds, that are small to moderately large and have a strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well.          Order: PasseriformesFamily: Emberizidae          The emberizids are a large family of passerine birds. They are seed-eating birds with distinctively shaped bills. In Europe, most species are called buntings. In North America, most of the species in this family are known as sparrows, but these birds are not closely related to the Old World sparrows which are in the family Passeridae. Many emberizid species have distinctive head patterns.          Order: PasseriformesFamily: Cardinalidae          The cardinals are a family of robust, seed-eating birds with strong bills. They are typically associated with open woodland. The sexes usually have distinct plumages.

510840,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=510840,Bennett Cerf,"Bennett Alfred Cerf (May 25, 1898 – August 27, 1971) was an American publisher, one of the founders of American publishing firm Random House. Cerf was also known for his own compilations of jokes and puns, for regular personal appearances lecturing across the United States, and for his television appearances in the panel game show ""What's My Line?""          Bennett was born on May 25, 1898 in Manhattan, New York to a Jewish family of Alsatian and German origin. Cerf's father Gustave Cerf was a lithographer; his mother Frederika Wise was heiress to a tobacco-distribution fortune. She died when Bennett was fifteen; shortly afterward, her brother Herbert moved into the Cerf household and became a strong literary and social influence on the teenager.          Cerf attended Townsend Harris High School, the same public school as publisher Richard Simon and playwright Howard Dietz. He spent his teenage years at 790 Riverside Drive, an apartment building in Washington Heights that was home to two friends who became prominent as adults: Howard Dietz and Hearst newspapers financial editor Merryle Rukeyser. He received his Bachelor of Arts from Columbia College of Columbia University (1919) and his Litt.B. (1920) from its School of Journalism. After graduation, he briefly worked as a reporter for the ""New York Herald Tribune"" and for some time in a Wall Street brokerage. He then was named a vice-president of the publishing firm Boni & Liveright.          In 1925, Cerf and Donald S. Klopfer formed a partnership to purchase the rights to the Modern Library from Boni & Liveright, and they went into business for themselves. They increased the popularity of the series and, in 1927, they began publishing general trade books which they had selected ""at random."" This began their publishing business, which in time they named Random House. It used as its logo a little house drawn by Cerf's friend and fellow Columbia alumnus Rockwell Kent.          Cerf's talent in building and maintaining relationships brought contracts with such writers as William Faulkner, John O'Hara, Eugene O'Neill, James Michener, Truman Capote, Theodor Seuss Geisel, and others. He published ""Atlas Shrugged,"" written by Ayn Rand, even though he vehemently disagreed with her philosophy of Objectivism. He admired her ""sincerity"" and ""brillian[ce],"" and the two became lifelong friends.          In 1933, Cerf won ""United States v. One Book Called Ulysses,"" a landmark court case against government censorship, and thereafter he published James Joyce's unabridged ""Ulysses"" for the first time in the United States. (One chapter had been published in Margaret Anderson's and Jane Heap's ""The Little Review,"" a Chicago-based literary magazine, which had led to its being found ""a work of obscenity."") In 1933, Random House had the rights to publish the book in the United States, and they arranged for a test case to challenge the implicit ban so as to publish the work without fear of prosecution. The publisher therefore made an arrangement to import the French edition of the book and to have a copy seized by the United States Customs Service when the ship arrived carrying the work. Despite advance warning to Customs of the anticipated arrival of the book, the local official declined to confiscate it, stating that ""everybody brings that in."" He and his superior were finally convinced to seize the work. The United States Attorney then took seven months before deciding whether to proceed further. The Assistant U.S. Attorney assigned to assess the work's obscenity felt that it was a ""literary masterpiece""—yet he also found it obscene within the meaning of the law. The office, therefore, decided to take action against the work under the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, which allowed a district attorney to bring action. Cerf later presented the French-language book to Columbia University.          In 1944, Cerf published the first of his collection of joke books ""Try and Stop Me,"" with illustrations drawn by Carl Rose. A second book ""Shake Well Before Using"" was published in 1949. It was at this time that he became a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors, serving from 1946 through 1967, then returning to the board from 1970 to 1971. Additionally, he served as Chair Juror of the Peabody Jurors Board from 1954 to the end of his first term in 1967 and published a weekly column titled ""The Cerf Board,"" in the Sunday supplement magazine ""This Week.""           In the early 1950s, while maintaining a Manhattan residence, Cerf bought an estate at Mount Kisco, New York which became his country home for the rest of his life. A Mount Kisco street named Cerf Lane runs from Croton Avenue and is named after him. Cerf married actress Sylvia Sidney on October 1, 1935; they divorced seven months later on April 9, 1936. He married Hollywood actress Phyllis Fraser, a cousin of Ginger Rogers, on September 17, 1940. They had two sons, Christopher and Jonathan.          In 1959, Maco Magazine Corporation published what became known as ""The Cream of the Master's Crop,"" a compilation of Cerf's jokes, gags, stories, puns, and wit.          Prior to 1951, Cerf was an occasional panelist on the NBC game show ""Who Said That?"", in which celebrities try to determine the speaker of quotations taken from recent news reports. In 1951, he began appearing weekly on ""What's My Line?"" and continued until the show ended its run on CBS in 1967. Until his death, Cerf continued to appear regularly on the CBS Films, Inc. (now Viacom) syndicated version of ""What's My Line?"", along with Arlene Francis. Cerf was known as ""Bennett Snerf"" in a ""Sesame Street"" puppet parody of ""What's My Line?"". During his time on ""What's My Line?"", Cerf received an honorary degree from the University of Puget Sound.          Cerf was interviewed in 1967 and 1968 by Robin Hawkins, a freelancer working for the Oral History Research Office at Columbia University. He claimed that, of all the awards which he'd received in his life, he was ""genuinely proud of"" those bestowed on him by humor magazines ""The Yale Record"" and ""The Harvard Lampoon"".          Cerf was the subject of Jessica Mitford's exposé, published in the June 1970 issue of ""Atlantic Monthly,"" which denounced the business practices of the Famous Writers School which Cerf had founded.          Cerf was portrayed in the film ""Infamous"" (2006) by Peter Bogdanovich. S.J. Perelman's feuilleton ""No Dearth of Mirth, Fill Out the Coupon"" describes Perelman's fictionalized encounter with a jokebook publisher named Barnaby Chirp who is a caricature of Cerf. Another caricature of Cerf is named Harry Hubris and portrayed by Bert Lahr, and appears in Perelman's 1962 play ""The Beauty Part"". He was also referred to as publisher ""Bennett Blake"" in an episode of ""The Patty Duke Show"".          Cerf died from natural causes in Mount Kisco, New York, on August 27, 1971, aged 73, survived by his wife and sons.          In 1977 Random House published his autobiography, which he had titled ""At Random: The Reminiscences of Bennett Cerf"".          Bennett Cerf Drive just outside the City of Westminster in Carroll County, Maryland is named after him. This is the location of one of two Random House distribution facilities in the U.S., known as the Random House Westminster Distribution Center & Offices, and also a park, Bennett Cerf Park.","['1898 births', '1971 deaths', 'American book publishers (people)', 'American Jews', 'American people of German-Jewish descent', 'American television personalities', 'Jewish American writers', 'Random House', 'Townsend Harris High School alumni', 'Columbia University alumni', 'Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni']"

23616237,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23616237,Natalya Estemirova,"Natalya Khusainovna Estemirova (; 28 February 1958 – 15 July 2009) was an award-winning Russian human rights activist and board member of the Russian human rights organization Memorial. Estemirova was abducted by unknown persons on 15 July 2009 around 8:30 a.m. from her home in Grozny, Chechnya, as she was working on ""extremely sensitive"" cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Two witnesses reported they saw Estemirova being pushed into a car shouting that she was being abducted. Her remains were found with bullet wounds in the head and chest area at 4:30 p.m. in woodland away from the federal road ""Kavkaz"" near the village of Gazi-Yurt, Ingushetia.          Born in Kamyshlov, Sverdlovsk Oblast to Russian and Chechen parents, Estemirova graduated with a degree in history from Grozny University and taught history in a local high school until 1998. In 1991, she worked as a correspondent for the local newspapers ""The Voice"" and ""The Worker of Grozny"". While working on TV in Grozny, she filmed thirteen short documentaries about victims of the Russian punitive practices. She participated in the Organization of Filtration Camps Inmates as a press-secretary. The widow of a Chechen policeman, she gathered evidence on human rights violations since the beginning of the Second Chechen war in 1999, leaving her daughter in Yekaterinburg with relatives. In 2000, she became a representative for the Memorial Human Rights Centre in her native Grozny. She visited many hospitals in Chechnya and Ingushetia, taking hundreds of photographs of child victims of the war.          Estemirova was a frequent contributor to the independent Moscow newspaper ""Novaya Gazeta"" and the Caucasus news website Kavkazsky Uzel.          Estemirova received the Right Livelihood Award at a ceremony in the Swedish parliament building in 2004. Along with Sergey Kovalyov, chairman of Memorial, she was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal by the Group of the European People's Party in 2005. In October 2007, she was awarded the first Anna Politkovskaya Award by Reach All Women in War (RAW), a human rights organization supporting women human rights defenders in war and conflict (see also Anna Politkovskaya Award). Estemirova worked with investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya and human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov, both of whom were also murdered, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.          Estemirova was abducted on 15 July 2009 from her home in Grozny, Chechnya. According to Tanya Lokshina of the Moscow bureau of Human Rights Watch, unknown individuals abducted Estemirova near her house in Grozny at around 8:30 a.m. Her colleagues raised an alert when she did not come to a planned meeting and went to her home, found witnesses and questioned them. Two witnesses reportedly saw Estemirova being pushed into a car shouting that she was being abducted. Lokshina said Estemirova was abducted as she was working on ""extremely sensitive"" cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Lokshina said that she had been targeted for her professional activities. Human Rights Watch had demanded to the Kremlin and Ramzan Kadyrov that Estemirova be returned home safely.          Vladimir Markin, press secretary for the investigative committee of the Prosecutor General of Russia, said a body of a woman with bullet wounds in the head and chest was found at 4:30 p.m. in woodland 100 m away from the federal road ""Kavkaz"" near the village of Gazi-Yurt, Ingushetia. Investigators found items belonging to Estemirova in the purse of the woman. These items were a passport, an ID of the Chechnya expert for the Human Rights Commissioner of Russia and the mandate of the penitentiary supervision public committee.          Estemirova was ""buried in line with Islamic tradition before sunset on Thursday, in a cemetery in her ancestral village, Koshkeldy, in Chechnya's Gudermes district.""          About 150 people attended a vigil that was held in Moscow's Pushkin Square about nine days after the murder, following Russian Orthodox tradition. After all but twenty people had left, police arrested the organizer of the event, Viktor Sotirko of Memorial. He was held for two hours and charged with disturbing the peace. Police said only 30 people had been sanctioned to attend the event, but far more had shown up.          The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, stationed in Moscow, reported that Estemirova was engaged in ""very important and dangerous work"", investigating hundreds of cases of alleged kidnappings, torture and extrajudicial killings by Russian government troops or paramilitaries in Chechnya.          Russian President Dmitri Medvedev expressed ""outrage"" at the murder and ordered a top-level investigation. Speaking in Germany at the time of her funeral, he paid tribute to her and again pledged a thorough investigation. He said it was ""obvious"" to him that her murder was linked to her professional work.          Memorial claimed that ""state terror"" was to blame, calling the killing an ""extrajudicial execution"" by government-backed death squads. Memorial's chairman Oleg Orlov said that Ramzan Kadyrov threatened Natalya and that Russian president Medvedev was content with Kadyrov being a murderer. Orlov said in a statement: ""I know, I am sure who is guilty of Natalya Estemirova's murder, we all know him. His name is Ramzan Kadyrov."" According to Orlov, shortly before the murder Kadyrov made an open threat to her by saying: ""Yes, my hands are up to the elbows in blood. And I am not ashamed of that. I killed and will kill bad people"". Kadyrov denied any involvement and promised to investigate the killing personally. He condemned the killers, saying they ""must be punished as the cruelest of criminals"". It was later reported that in response to Orlov's accusation, Kadyrov would be suing the rights group for defamation, and would target Orlov personally in the complaint. Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, Chechen human rights ombudsman, called Orlov's accusation ""groundless and ludicrous"".           In January 2010, Ramzan Kadyrov, in an interview to ""Russia Today"" accused Berezovsky of murdering Estemirova. Despite expressing confidence that the crime will be solved, he acknowledged that as of that date it had not:           Medvedev responded to the accusation, saying the timing of the crime, a day before his trip to Germany for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel, was a provocation intended to give rise to ""the most primitive theories and those most disagreeable to the state"". Merkel said she expressed her ""outrage"" over the killing in her talks with Medvedev ""and made clear that everything must be done to solve this crime"".          United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said he was ""appalled and saddened"" by Estemirova's murder. UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe stated that Ban ""urges the Russian authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation in order to bring the perpetrators of this heinous killing to justice, and by doing so, to send a strong and unambiguous message that the targeting of human rights activists will not be tolerated"". The chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, Joseph Daul, condemned the perpetrators and called for an investigation and bringing the perpetrators to trial.          In February 2010 an anonymous source in the Russian law enforcement bodies claimed that investigators knew Estemirova's murderer. Yet, the murderer wasn't caught, nor was the organizer of the crime identified.           Journalists of ""Novaya Gazeta"" together with the human rights society Memorial and the International Federation for Human Rights are conducting their own investigation, they also monitor the official investigation. According to them, the main version of the official investigators is that Estemirova was murdered by rebel Alkhazur Bashayev, a member of a jamaat in the Chechen village of Shalazhy (Шалажи). On 15 January 2010 during a search in the house of Alkhazur Bashayev, the investigators found a large stockpile of weapons, including the handgun that was used to murder Estemirova and a counterfeit police id with a photograph of Bashayev. On 7 February 2010, they found an abandoned VAZ-2107 car that was identified as the car bought by Bashayev. In the car they found a suppressor made of the same material as the fragment found on the crime scene. The plant fragments found on the suspension on the car were similar to the plants found at the crime scene.           According to the official investigators, Bashayev was trying to smear Kadyrov and the leadership of the Chechen Republic, and he might also have been upset by publications by Estemirova where she had alleged that Bashayev had been recruiting for the rebel group without any opposition of the officials and suggested that he might be an agent for Kadyrovtsy.          According to the official information, on 13 November 2009, Bashayev was killed by an air strike during a special operation led by Adam Delimkhanov.

Written during a time of rapid increase in life expectancy (at the time of its publication American life expectancy at birth was around 60 and climbing fast, from being only ""at"" age 40 fifty years before), it was very popular and influential. It was the #1 bestselling non-fiction book in the United States in 1933, and #2 in 1934, according to ""Publishers Weekly"".          Although Pitkin did not necessarily coin the phrase ""life begins at forty"", the success of his book entered it into general circulation, such that after 1932 it became an American catchphrase for the remainder of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first (it is the title of a 1935 Will Rogers movie, a 1937 song sung by Sophie Tucker, a 1980 John Lennon song, two television series (in 1978 in Britain and 2003 in Hong Kong), and several novels and other books).          More an extended essay and exhortation than a detailed self-help book in the modern sense, the general thrust of the book is that, given the current conditions of the world, one could look forward to many years of fulfilling and happy existence after age 40, provided that one maintained the proper positive attitude.","['1932 books', 'Self-help books']"

45229464,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45229464,San Pedro Cemetery Museum,"The San Pedro Cemetery Museum is a cemetery and museum located in Medellín, Colombia. It was constructed in 1842, named a museum in 1998, and declared a National Monument of Colombia in 1999. This place is an integral part of the cultural and architectural heritage of the city. It is administered by the Foundation of San Pedro Cemetery.          Funerary monuments are erected here in memory of prominent figures in the history of Colombia. Although it falls under the category of funerary sculptures and architecture, the space has begun to emerge as a new venue for artistic dissemination. Local and national collections of art are preserved there and, in full moon nights, concerts, shows, storytelling, theater, and dance performances are held.          The Cemetery San Pedro was founded in 1842, when the small town of La Candelaria (present-day Medellín) had 9000 inhabitants and only 16 years had passed since it became the new capital of Antioquia. This time was characterized by great advances in the town, such as a population increase and strengthening of major economic groups, wars fought between political parties, colonization of western Colombia, the consolidation of trade, the birth of the industry, railroad building and navigating the Magdalena River. Specifically, the cemetery was founded on July 8, 1842 under the initiative of Pedro Uribe Restrepo, who called a meeting of important families of the Villa de la Candelaria. They agreed to the founding of a new cemetery, seeing the lack of one worth their families, since the Cemetery of San Lorenzo, which was founded in January 1828, was the only one there and, therefore, was too small to continue providing the service to the families of Medellín.          The partners decided to buy land in the ridge of El Llano (today Bolivar Street). The lot was 125 yards long by 200 yards wide and on 30 September 1842 the deed of purchase was signed. The cemetery was called the ""New Cemetery, of Individuals"" or ""of San Vicente of Paul"" until 1871, when it changed names to San Pedro Cemetery. Because it was founded by members of the commercial, political, and intellectual elite of the time, it began to be called the cemetery of rich or ""white city"", for the many mausoleums and sculptures made of Carrara marble, most brought from Pietrasanta, Italy.          With the growth and progress of Medellín, the cemetery needed to make additions and alterations to improve service, whereby the surrounding land was acquired. The first gallery built was that of San Lorenzo on the southwest side of the main courtyard and from this model was consolidated throughout the territory with similar constructions for the entire set. In the 1920s, various projects were started. During this time, engineer and Belgian architect Agustín Goovaerts created the cemetery's chapel in 1925 and a monument for Camilo Restrepo in 1926.          Between 1996 and 1997 an evaluation and investigation was conducted, the result of this evaluation defined the need to seek protective mechanisms for a work that had a high degree of deterioration. In 1997 the institution Colcultura (today known as the Ministry of Culture) was solicited to declare the Cemetery of San Pedro as a National Monument of Colombia.          The following is a select list of famous people interred in the cemetery: Fidel Cano, Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, Pedro Nel Ospina, Luciano Restrepo Escobar, Pedro Justo Berrío, Carlos Coriolano Amador, José María Sierra, Alejandro Ángel, Efe Gómez, Luis López de Mesa, Félix de Bedout Moreno, Manuel Uribe Ángel, Pedro Estrado, Luis Eduardo Yepes, Jorge Isaacs, Francisco Antonio Cano, Marco Tobón Mejía, Bernardo Vieco Ortiz, Jorge Marín Vieco, Pedro Nel Gómez, Constantino Carvajal, Rafael Sáenz,","['National Monuments of Colombia', 'Cemeteries in Colombia', 'Museums in Medell\xc3\xadn']"

10632302,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10632302,Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,"SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene includes the pop and rock music of the former SFR Yugoslavia, including all their genres and subgenres. The scene included the constituent republics: SR Slovenia, SR Croatia, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Montenegro, SR Macedonia and SR Serbia and its subunits: SAP Vojvodina and SAP Kosovo. The pop and rock scene was a part of the general Music of Yugoslavia, which also included folk, classical music, jazz etc. Within Yugoslavia and internationally, the phrase ""ex Yugoslav Pop and Rock"" both formally and informally always refers to the SFRY period only, not including Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992–2003).          The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was not an Eastern Bloc country, but a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement and as such, it was far more open to western influences compared to the other socialist states. The western-influenced pop and rock music was socially accepted, the Yugoslav pop and rock music scene was well developed and covered in the media, which included numerous magazines, radio and TV shows. Numerous artists even played for president Josip Broz Tito himself, notably Bijelo Dugme, Zdravko Čolić and Rani Mraz. SFR Yugoslavia was the only Socialist country which was taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest. It joined in 1961 even before some Western and NATO nations such as Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Turkey, which joined in 1964, 1965, 1974 and 1975 respectively. Unlike the citizens of other Socialist countries, Yugoslavs enjoyed freedom of travel and had an easy access to Western popular culture.          One of the first stars in the former Socialist Yugoslavia and one of its first internationally acclaimed artists, was the traditional pop singer Ivo Robić from Croatia, who emerged in the Yugoslav music scene in the late 1940s. Later, he went abroad, where he made a successful international career. He was the original performer of the famous ""Strangers in the Night"" song by Bert Kaempfert, predating Frank Sinatra who recorded his version later in 1966.          Robić closely cooperated with Kaempfert throughout most of his career. In the early 1960s, after seeing a promising young act from England performing at the Top Ten Club in Hamburg, Robić convinced Kaempfert, who was Polydor's agent, to help those youngsters in their career. Kaempfert accepted and thanks to him the group was hired to record together with the then popular Tony Sheridan. The young group was The Beatles. Those were their first commercial recordings ever, including ""My Bonnie"", ""Ain't She Sweet"" and ""Cry for a Shadow"". That album was released in numerous versions such as ""In the Beginning (Circa 1960)"", ""The Beatles' First"" and ""Beatles Bop - Hamburg Days"".          The rock and roll scene in Yugoslavia started to emerge in the 1950s influenced by the classical rock and roll and rockabilly acts such as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Bill Haley, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly and others. Many young people started to play this new ""electric music"", as they called it, naming themselves ""električari"", but one of the first who rose to prominence was the guitarist Mile Lojpur from Belgrade (born in Zrenjanin in 1930). He was tributed by many musicians later, notably by Nikola Čuturilo. Other eminent act that started in the 1950s rock 'n' roll scene was Karlo Metikoš from Zagreb, who after moving to Paris started an international career under the pseudonym Matt Collins. He recorded for Philips Records and had an opportunity to meet legends such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Paul Anka.          A notable singer who emerged in the late 1950s was Đorđe Marjanović, who became the first Yugoslav megastar.          The beginning of the 1960s saw the emergence of numerous bands, many of them initially inspired by the then-popular Cliff Richard and The Shadows: Bijele Strijele and Siluete, formed in 1961; the Zagreb-based Crveni Koralji and Belgrade's Zlatni Dečaci in 1962; in 1963 two other important Belgrade bands were formed, Samonikli and Crni Biseri, the latter featuring Vlada Janković-Džet, a prominent Yugoslav musician, who got his nickname after Jet Harris. The Zagreb-based Delfini were also formed the same year. After the British invasion, many of these bands later moved on to British rhythm and blues. In Skopje, a popular 1960s rock 'n' roll group was formed named Bisbez who were considered ""The Macedonian Beatles"". They were formed by merging two already existing bands Biseri and Bezimeni.          The 1960s also saw the expansion of Beatlemania. Many new bands formed influenced by The Beatles or by the Rolling Stones, both of whom had large fanbases in SFR Yugoslavia. There were frequent arguments between the fans of both groups, though not necessarily violent. One of the important source of information for the youths to stay up-to-date with the rock music developments around the world was Radio Luxembourg. Certain British artists held concerts in Yugoslavia (e.g. The Searchers, The Hollies) and also Yugoslav artists performed around Europe, especially neighbouring Italy and Austria. On the border with Italy, several Yugoslav-Italian beat music festivals took place.          In the mid-1960s many bands such as Džentlmeni, Roboti and the reformed Siluete were influenced by the rhythm and blues artists, while others were more pop oriented. Mod oriented bands also emerged. The most popular foreign bands were The Animals, The Byrds, The Monkees The Kinks, The Who, Manfred Mann and others. The garage rock sound (also labeled as ""1960s Punk"") was also popular. The charismatic frontman of Siluete, Zoran Miščević, became an idol of the new generation and a sex symbol. The band had a bad reputation for causing scandals and riots at their concerts. Their main rivals were the group Elipse, which, after getting a new vocalist, the African student from Congo Edi Dekeng, went on to play soul music.          The prominent Croatian singer Tereza Kesovija represented Monaco at the Eurovision Song Contest 1966.          One of the most eminent and influential former Yugoslav group formed in the 1960s was Indexi. They were formed in Sarajevo in 1962. In their early beginnings they were notably influenced by The Shadows and later by The Beatles. Along with the numerous evergreen songs they wrote featuring Davorin Popović's trademark nasal voice, they also covered the famous Beatles song ""Nowhere Man"". In some of their songs they also experimented with the sound in a similar way to ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"". Indexi gradually moved to a more psychedelic sound, with more complex guitar and keyboard solos adding occasional folk and even classical music elements. One of the band's notable members Kornelije Kovač, left Indeksi to form another legendary band, Korni Grupa, in Belgrade in 1968.          As the end of the 1960s was approaching, the hippie movement expanded around the world as well as in SFR Yugoslavia. Notable group was the Croatian-based Grupa 220, which during a certain period featured Piko Stančić. Later he rose to one of the most important musicians, producers and arrangers in the whole former Yugoslav scene.          Under influences such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, many young people embraced the acoustic sound and thus were called ""akustičari"" contrary to""električari""          ,electricians. Prominent acoustic artist was Ivica Percl, formerly of Roboti. He was an acoustic musician and peace activist playing guitar and harmonica influenced by Bob Dylan and Donovan.          The year of 1968 was marked by youth protests around the world including massive student demonstrations in many cities all over SFR Yugoslavia.          Another popular act at the time was the group Ambasadori. One of the members of both Ambasadori and Korni Grupa was Zdravko Čolić, who went solo later and was acclaimed as the biggest pop star in the former Yugoslavia. The most notable female vocalist was Josipa Lisac who still enjoys huge popularity across the former SFR Yugoslavia. Boba Stefanović was one of the most prominent Yugoslav male solo vocalists.          The Hippie era was marked by the famous musical ""Hair"". Numerous subsequent productions were staged around the world since its American debut in 1967, for example in Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina, Israel and Japan. The Yugoslav production was the first staged in a Socialist state, and it was highly praised by the ""Hair""'s original authors Gerome Ragni and James Rado, who were travelling from one country to another to watch each of the performances. As Ragni said, they found the Belgrade show ""so beautiful, so spontaneous that we had to go right on the stage to share their enthusiasm"". While being in Belgrade he also added ""There exist no middle-class prejudices here"".          Many pop music festivals existed across SFR Yugoslavia including the Split Festival, Opatija Festival, Beogradsko proleće in Belgrade, Skopje Fest, Vaš šlager sezone in Sarajevo, and later also Makfest in Štip was established. The family-friendly pop music played at those festivals was comparable to older Eurovision Song Contests, the German schlager genre, the Italian Sanremo Music Festival or the adult oriented pop music category. The specific Dalmatian pop sound featuring local folk elements performed at festivals held along the touristy Adriatic coast was very popular and some of its most notable exponents were Oliver Dragojević and Mišo Kovač.          The 1970s were marked by rock genres such as hard rock, progressive rock, jazz rock, art rock, glam rock, folk rock, symphonic rock, blues rock and boogie rock. In that period, some of the greatest Yugoslav stadium rock bands emerged: YU grupa, Time, Smak, Parni valjak, Atomsko Sklonište, Leb i Sol, Teška industrija and Galija.          In 1974 one of greatest rock groups ever formed in SFR Yugoslavia came to prominence, the Sarajevo based Bijelo Dugme with its first singer Željko Bebek.          Many foreign pop and rock stars visited Yugoslavia, including the Deep Purple concerts in Zagreb and Belgrade in 1975 with the local support acts Hobo and Smak in each of the cities respectively, and the Rolling Stones concert in Zagreb in 1976.          Several rock music festivals existed of which ""BOOM"" was one of the most popular. A rock music event that marked the decade, but also the Yugoslav rock history in general, was the Bijelo Dugme's concert at Hajdučka česma in Košutnjak Park in Belgrade on August 22, 1977, which was attended by around 80,000 people. (Parts of) the recorded material were released on the live album ""Koncert kod Hajdučke česme"".          1975 saw the emergence of a very influential act, Buldožer from Slovenia, noted for its experimental rock, which was a reaction pointed against the musical scene of the time.          The Yugoslav scene also featured several notable singer-songwriters, who emphasized their poetry over music, and usually performed accompanying themselves by an acoustic guitar or piano. Some of them were inspired by the French chanson or folk rock. One of the first critically acclaimed singer-songwriters was the Croatian artist Arsen Dedić who started his career in the 1960s and is still popular in his homeland and around the former Yugoslav countries, especially among the older generation. Another important author was also Đorđe Balašević from Novi Sad. He started his music career in the 1970s as a member of Žetva and Rani Mraz, before beginning a very successful solo career that continues up to the present. Despite being into acoustic rock initially, later he often used various elements of pop and rock often spiced up either with typical Vojvodinian humour or a ballad type of melancholy. A notable female artist in this category was Jadranka Stojaković from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. She was an author of the main music theme for the 1984 Winter Olympics held in Sarajevo. Since 1988, she resides in Japan. An artist notable for socially engaged lyrics was Marko Brecelj, formerly a member of Buldožer.          The disco craze spread around the world in the 1970s conquering Yugoslavia as well. Similarly to the disco movie ""Saturday Night Fever"", Zdravko Čolić became a sort of ""Yugoslav John Travolta"" dancing in stadiums across the country, dressed in a tight white suit and the then-fashionable bell-bottoms. At the legendary concert at the Belgrade stadium ""Marakana"" on September 5, 1978, about 70,000 people gathered to see him. The concert was also attended by representatives of a West German record label. Impressed by Čolić's popularity they offered him a record contract. He released the songs ""Jedina"" and ""Zagrli me"" for the Western German market and also an English language single featuring the songs ""I'm not a Robot Man"" and ""Light Me"". Čolić was offered to move to West Germany and start a career there, but he refused favouring the popularity he had at home. His song about a relationship with a posh girl ""Pusti, Pusti modu"" became a nationwide disco megahit in 1980. Despite that the disco fashion soon faded, Čolić continued his successful career as a pop music singer occasionally using folk music elements and remained popular in the former Yugoslav countries up to this day.          This era also brought in a one-hit wonder called Mirzino Jato, labeled by the media as kitschy euro disco band obviously influenced by Boney M., who were quite popular in Yugoslavia, especially after their only male member Bobby Farrell married a girl from Skopje's predominantly Romani inhabited municipality Šuto Orizari. Mirzino Jato's style encompassed the deep, subwoofer shaking voice of Sarajevo opera and classical choir singer Mirza Alijagić and the three sexy back vocalists called ""Jato"" (trans. ""Flock""). Music was written and produced by Divlje Jagode guitarist Sead Lipovača, while the author of most lyrics was Marina Tucaković, who later became famous writing lyrics for other musical styles. Despite their huge popularity at the time, Mirzino Jato never got past the first album. Its only considerable hit was ""Apsolutno tvoj"".          One of the best known dance songs in this period was also the Dado Topić's opening track of the 1979 film ""Nacionalna klasa"" starring Dragan Nikolić as Floyd, the fanatic car racer.          Gordi were one of the first Yugoslav heavy metal bands and are considered one of the pioneers of classic heavy metal in Yugoslavia. Hard rock group Riblja Čorba, known for their provocative social-related lyrics and controversial political attitudes of the band's frontman Bora Đorđević was one of the most important groups of the Yugoslav and Serbian rock in general. Riblja Čorba drummer Vicko Milatović formed heavy metal band Warriors, which later moved to Canada and recorded an album for the foreign market. The eminent heavy metal group Divlje Jagode from Bihać, led by guitarist Sead ""Zele"" Lipovača started a short-lasting international career in 1987 under the name Wild Strawberries. Another notable Bosnian hard rock group was Vatreni Poljubac led by charismatic Milić Vukašinović, formerly a member of Bijelo Dugme. Other notable hard rock and heavy metal bands include Generacija 5, Rok Mašina, Kerber and Griva from Serbia; Osmi Putnik (whose frontman Zlatan Stipišić Gibonni, later started a successful pop music career) and Crna Udovica (later changed their name to Big Blue) from Croatia; Pomaranča from Slovenia, and others. Yugoslav glam metal scene featured few acts, most notable being Karizma and Osvajači.          The Yugoslav punk rock scene emerged in the late 1970s, influenced by the first wave of punk rock bands from the United Kingdom and United States, such as Sex Pistols and The Clash and others, but also the proto-punk bands such as MC5, The Stooges and New York Dolls. The DIY punkzine scene also started to develop. The Yugoslav punk bands were the first punk bands ever formed in a socialist state. Some of the first ones were formed in SR Slovenia and SR Croatia: Pankrti from Ljubljana (formed in 1977) and Paraf from Rijeka (depending on the source, formed in 1976 or 1977). The Slovenian and Croatian scene of that period is featured in the compilation album ""Novi Punk Val"", compiled by Igor Vidmar. Late 1970s-early 1980s Belgrade scene included: Urbana Gerila, Radnička Kontrola and many others. This generation of bands was included on the ""Artistička Radna Akcija"" compilation. Pekinška Patka was a cult band coming from Novi Sad. Some of the notable punk bands in SR Macedonia included: Fol Jazik, arguably the first punk band in Skopje, formed in 1978; Afektiven naboj from Struga formed in 1979 feat. Goran Trajkoski; Other notable acts from Skopje included Badmingtons and Saraceni, both led by Vladimir Petrovski Karter. In Sarajevo, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, the following artists emerged: Ozbiljno Pitanje (which later evolved into the pop-rock star band Crvena Jabuka), Ševa (which later evolved into Bombaj Štampa led by the charismatic Branko Đurić), and the cult band Zabranjeno Pušenje. These Sarajevian bands later formed the punk-inspired New Primitives movement, an important phenomenon in the former Yugoslav culture.          In the late 1970s, some punk bands were affiliated with the new wave music scene, and were labeled as both punk rock and new wave. During a certain period, the term ""new wave music"" was interchangeable with ""punk"".          The end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s saw the emergence of various subgenres of punk rock, such as streetpunk and Oi!. Later came hardcore punk, followed by various extreme styles such as crust punk, crossover thrash all the way to grindcore. Notable hardcore punk acts during the 1980s included: Niet, Patareni, KBO! and others. A notable mainstream pop punk band was Psihomodo Pop from Croatia (heavily influenced by The Ramones). Many eminent foreign punk bands played concerts around former Yugoslavia including: The Ruts, Siouxsie and the Banshees, U.K. Subs, Angelic Upstarts, The Exploited and The Anti-Nowhere League. In 1983 The Anti-Nowhere League released their album ""Live in Yugoslavia"", while Angelic Upstarts released a live album with the same title in 1985. Beside musicians, the Yugoslav punk subculture also included punk writers and artists, with Ivan Glišić from Šabac being one of the notable ones.          The new wave music scene emerged in the late 1970s and had a significant impact on Yugoslav culture. As its counterparts – the British and the US new wave music scenes, from which the main influences came from, the Yugoslav new wave scene was also closely related to Punk rock, Ska, Reggae, 2 Tone, Power pop, Mod Revival etc. The new wave was especially advocated by the music magazines ""Polet"" from Zagreb and Džuboks from Belgrade, and by the TV show Rokenroler, which was famous for its artistic music videos.          Important bands of the Yugoslav new wave are: Prljavo kazalište, Novi fosili, Šarlo Akrobata, Idoli, Azra, Električni orgazam, Haustor, Film, Laboratorija Zvuka, Lačni Franz, Cilindar and many others. This period in the former Yugoslav music is considered a ""Golden age"". All of these artists still have status of cult bands.          Symbols of the Yugoslav new wave era are the compilation albums ""Paket aranžman"", ""Novi Punk Val"", ""Artistička Radna Akcija"" and especially movies ""Davitelj protiv davitelja"" (starring Idoli member Srđan Šaper) and ""Dečko koji obećava"" (starring Aleksandar Berček and featuring appearances by members of Šarlo Akrobata and Idoli).          An important rockumentary covering this period is ""Sretno dijete"".          As the new wave perished in the beginning of the 1980s, some of the bands split or took different musical directions. The period around 1982 is considered especially crucial concerning the decline of the new wave in Yugoslavia, but also around the world. Many new important bands formed in 1982 after the new wave faded: Dušan Kojić-Koja, the former bass player of Šarlo Akrobata formed the legendary group Disciplina Kičme (a unique noisy mix of punk rock, funk, jazz fusion and many other styles). The band later rose to international prominence and appeared on MTV. Zoran Kostić-Cane, the former vocalist of Radnička Kontrola, formed the furious garage punk group Partibrejkers and achieved huge success. Idoli, Prljavo Kazalište and Film (the latter under the moniker ""Jura Stublić i Film"") became pop-rock and all of them respectively achieved great mainstream success; The cult band Azra gradually moved on to a more conventional rock sound with occasional use of folk rock. Johnny Štulić's poetic trademarks were still notable throughout their lyrics. Električni Orgazam went through a psychedelic phase and later became a successful mainstream rock band inspired mostly by the 1960s sound.          One of the most prominent mainstream dance pop acts during the decade, especially in the early 1980s, was Oliver Mandić. He used transvestite elements in his stage and video performances long before Boy George emerged. His music utilized lots of funk dance music. The national Radio-Television Belgrade filmed the famous TV show featuring a collection of his music videos called ""Beograd noću"" (""Belgrade by Night"") directed by Stanko Crnobrnja. The ambitiously avantgarde program won Rose d'Or award at the 1981 Montreux TV festival. Mandić's controversial image in the show, created by the conceptual artist Kosta Bunuševac, raised quite a public furor due to the singer's cross-dressing and aggressive makeup.          A former Riblja čorba member, Momčilo Bajagić Bajaga formed one of the most popular ex-Yugoslav acts ever, Bajaga i Instruktori. Later, Dejan Cukić, one of the members of Instruktori left the band and started a successful solo career.          Family-friendly pop acts during the 1980s were Novi Fosili and the Split based group Magazin, both featuring female vocalists.          1983 was marked by Danijel Popović, the Yugoslav performer at the Eurovision Song Contest in Munich. He instantly became a nationwide pop star, but was also acclaimed around Europe. West German and Swedish artists released cover versions of his hit ""Džuli"".          In the following year, at the national ESC pre-selection in Skopje, Dado Topić performed a duet with Slađana Milošević, known for her extravagant style comparable to that of Nina Hagen. Although their song ""Princeza"" did not win, it remained an evergreen pop ballad. Another notable duet was the song ""Jabuke i vino"" by Željko Bebek and Zana Nimani.          Zana Nimani was a notable artist from the Albanian minority, she was a frontress of the band Zana from Belgrade and later started a solo career.          The most popular TV show during the decade was ""Hit meseca"" (""Hit of the Month"") which was a sort of Yugoslav ""Top of the Pops"". The host of the show was Dubravka ""Duca"" Marković. A popular magazine among the youths was ""ITD"", which also had a version called ""Super ITD"" in a bigger format. The most prominent rock music magazines were ""Rock"" and ""Džuboks"".          Musical genres such as Post-punk, Gothic rock, Darkwave, New Romantic and Synthpop were already expanded in SFR Yugoslavia during the early 1980s, and especially at the end of 1980,s because of coming of new technologies such as Video recorders and Satellite Television in many homes in SFR Yugoslavia.          The former punks Pekinška Patka moved to post-punk and darkwave on their second, less acclaimed album ""Strah od monotonije"" released in 1981 and soon disbanded. Another legendary band, Paraf, moved from their initial punk rock phase and released their psychedelic album ""Izleti"" in 1982 with elements of post-punk and gothic rock. Električni Orgazam had a notable psychedelic phase, during which, they released their album ""Lišće prekriva Lisabon"" in 1982.          Milan Mladenović, formerly a guitarist of Šarlo Akrobata, in that same 1982 formed the cult band Ekatarina Velika, initially named Katarina II. The band is remembered for its darker poetic post-punk sound and its intellectual attitude. Some of its members included the bass guitar player Bojan Pečar, formerly a member of Via Talas and the drummer Srđan Todorović, who later rose to internationally acclaimed film actor. Margita Stefanović-Magi, the keyboard player, and Milan, the frontman both rose to a status of ""alternative celebrities"". Later, both died.          Notable art rock groups included the arty and extravagant Dorian Gray and Boa, both from Zagreb. The former, named after Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, formed in 1982, influenced by Roxy Music and Japan. It was led by Massimo Savić, later a successful pop singer. BOA formed in the 1970s, influenced by Yes, King Crimson and Genesis, but later turned to New Romantic. In 1990, it performed as David Bowie's opening act at Maksimir stadium.          During the New Romantic era popularized around the world by Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, prominent acts in Yugoslavia were the aforementioned Zagreb based group Boa and Jakarta from Belgrade.          Notable synthpop artists in the former Yugoslavia included: Beograd, formed in 1981, named after their hometown Belgrade; Videosex from Ljubljana, Slovenia, led by their charismatic frontress Anja Rupel; the duo Denis & Denis from Croatia featuring the sex-symbol Marina Perazić, who later started a solo career, and her boyfriend Davor Tolja; the humorous bunch Laki Pingvini and a similar act named D' Boys (pronounced as ""The Boys"") led by Peđa D' Boy, formerly a vocalist of the West German rock band Jane. In Macedonia, a notable synthesizer-led act was the group Bastion which featured the now internationally acclaimed electronic musician Kiril Džajkovski on electronic keyboards and Milcho Manchevski as a lyrics writer. Many Yugoslav artists in this period were already experimenting with the use of personal computers in creating of their music. The cover of the single ""Neka ti se dese prave stvari"" / ""Ne zovi to ljubavlju"" by the Belgrade-based group Data featured the then popular Commodore 64.          The New Primitivism was an urban subcultural movement in Sarajevo in the early 1980s. Some of projects that came from the New Primitives were the band Zabranjeno Pušenje, the ""Top lista nadrealista"" TV and radio show, the legendary group Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors, Bombaj Štampa and others. Its creators include Elvis J. Kurtović, dr. Nele Karajlić, mr. Sejo Sexon, Bombaj Stampa (featuring actor/director Branko Đurić — Đuro), Boris Šiber, Zenit Đozić from Sarajevo neighbourhood of Koševo. The famous film director Emir Kusturica was an associate and friend of the crew.          The fresh spirit that the group left in the urban Bosnian culture and a quite new way of expression, flooding directly from street subculture, attracted significant popularity and made it one of monuments of modern Bosnian culture.          The discourse of New Primitivism was primarily humorous, based on the spirit of Bosnian ordinary people from the cultural underground. They introduced the jargon, rich in Turcisms, of Sarajevo ""mahalas"" (suburban neighborhoods) into the official musical and TV scene. Most of their songs and sketches involve stories about small people – coalmine workers, petty criminals, provincial girls etc. - put in unusual or even absurd situations. There are comparisons between ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" show and New Primitives methods, as they share the form of short sketches and utilize absurdity as means to illicit laughs from the audience.          The name of the movement arguably came as a reaction to two then-actual movements: New Romantic in global pop music and Slovenian Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK).          In the late 1984 Bob Geldof and Midge Ure organized the famous famine relief campaign named Band Aid, which continued throughout 1985 until its finale – the historical Live Aid concert on 13 July 1985. The concert was broadcast worldwide including SFR Yugoslavia. Beside ""Do They Know it's Christmas?"" and USA for Africa projects from the UK and USA respectively, plenty of other countries also joined in. For example: Canada, West Germany, Austria, Norway etc. The SFR Yugoslav pop and rock elite also joined Geldof's campaign and formed a Yugoslav Band Aid under the name YU Rock Misija. The group included Oliver Mandić, Željko Bebek, Momčilo Bajagić, Slađana Milošević, Jura Stublić, Dado Topić, Zdravko Čolić, Izolda Barudžija, Snežana Mišković, Alen Islamović, Sead Lipovača, Dejan Cukić, Doris Dragović, Anja Rupel, Srđan Šaper, Vladimir Divljan, Peđa D' Boy, Zoran Predin and other eminent musicians. They recorded the Yugoslav Band Aid song ""Za million godina"" (""For a Million Years"") written by former Generacija 5 leader Dragan Ilić and Mladen Popović. The guitar solo in the song is played by Vlatko Stefanovski. The song was released as a single. Also a corresponding video was filmed. Bora Đorđević and Goran Bregović, leaders of Riblja Čorba and Bijelo Dugme were not credited on the record's back cover, however they appeared in a TV performance of the song. At the end of the campaign, the Yugoslav musicians played a big 8 hour stadium concert on June 15, 1985 in Belgrade. The video for ""Za million godina"" was played on many TV stations worldwide and also, on July 13 at the Wembley Stadium on large video screens during a video interlude. It is included, though not completely, in the ""Overseas contributors"" section in the official ""Live Aid DVD"" that was released in the 2004 by Warner Music Group.          Sarajevo developed a distinguishable pop and rock sound, often (but not necessarily) featuring Bosnian folk music elements, which became popular across the whole Yugoslav federation. It was the birthplace of one of the top Yugoslav rock bands Bijelo Dugme and the pop star Zdravko Čolić.          The scene began to develop in the 1960s with groups such as Indexi, Pro Arte and singer/songwriter Kemal Monteno. It continued into the 1970s with Ambasadori, Bijelo dugme and Vatreni poljubac, while the 1980s brought artists such as Plavi Orkestar, Crvena Jabuka, Hari Mata Hari, Dino Merlin, Valentino, Regina, Bolero and Gino Banana.          Sarajevo was also the home of the authentic punk-influenced subculture known as the New Primitives, which developed in the early 1980s and was brought into the mainstream by artists such as Zabranjeno Pušenje, Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors, Bombaj Štampa and the radio and TV comedy show Top Lista Nadrealista.          Notable industrial music acts in Yugoslavia were Laibach from Ljubljana, Autopsia from Ruma and SCH from Sarajevo.          The Yugoslav scene also included numerous neo-rockabilly, psychobilly and retro-rock and roll acts.          A noted artist was controversial Velibor ""Bora"" Miljković, better known as Toni Montano, nicknamed after Tony Montana, the main character of the movie Scarface. He was a former vocalist of the punk rock group Radost Evrope, ironically named after the famous international children's music festival ""Joy of Europe"" held annually in Belgrade. Toni often stirred controversy in his interviews and frequently attacked other musicians, like Ekaterina Velika and such, whom he considered pseudointellectuals who alienated themselves from the ""street"", where, according to him, the real rock music should emerge from. He arrogantly proclaimed himself a ""real rock star"" whose time is yet to come. However, he never really managed to achieve the success of his adversaries, who never bothered much with him anyway. His albums often included cover versions of famous punk rock tracks, such as the Sex Pistols' ""Friggin' in the Riggin'"" and ""Lonely Boy"". Espousing an macho rocker attitude and image, Toni's songs often featured sexist lyrics.          On the other hand, the group Đavoli from Split led by Nenad ""Neno"" Belan were a softer retro-rock 'n' roll act, they released several summer hits and also twist or surf music influenced tracks. Some of its members also had punk rock background.          The rockabilly group Fantomi was another act in Croatia, while in Serbia the group called Vampiri emerged with their trademark doo-wop style of singing and performed as a support act of the internationally acclaimed retro jazzy pop group Vaya Con Dios at their concert in Belgrade.          In Slovenia, the cult avant-garde band Laibach emerged in 1980. Experimenting with various styles such as industrial, martial and neo-classical music they rose to international prominence and influenced acts such as the famous group Rammstein for instance. They appeared on MTV with their cover version of ""Across the Universe"" by The Beatles, featuring a guest-appearance by Anja Rupel. One of the groups connected with NSK were Abbildungen Variete from Maribor.          The most notable electronic body music act was Borghesia, from Ljubljana, Slovenia.          While Slovenia had the Neue Slowenische Kunst movement, in Macedonia, the collective Makedonska Streljba was formed. The Macedonian darkwave and gothic rock scene featured some of the most prominent Macedonian acts ever, such as Mizar, Arhangel and Padot na Vizantija, the latter featuring Goran Trajkoski.          The Extreme metal music scene across SFR Yugoslavia was also developed. It included various thrash metal, speed metal and death metal acts. A festival called ""Hard Metal"" was taking place in Belgrade and also a magazine with the same name was published.          Notable acts included speed metal band Bombarder (initially formed in Sarajevo, later moved to Belgrade), Bloodbath (not to be confused with the Swedish band Bloodbath), Heller (the pioneers of Yugoslav thrash metal) and others. The thrash metal band Sanatorium was formed in Skopje in 1987. During its 20 years of existence, it shared stage with many prominent international stars such as Motörhead, Halford, Soulfly and others.          Many rap music artists emerged in SFR Yugoslavia throughout the 1980s. Breakdance groups also existed especially in the first half of the 1980s. A prominent breakdance rap act was The Master Scratch Band. They have released some works for Jugoton in 1984 including the track ""Break War"" featuring ""Hit Meseca"" host Dubravka ""Duca"" Marković. Disciplina Kičme also used rap music elements, though in their own specific way, always mixed with numerous other styles.          But there was an artist who utilized rap music in a very distinguishable manner. In the late 1980s, a charismatic musician of Montenegrin origin came into nationwide prominence: Rambo Amadeus. His pseudonym as well as his music encompassed an intellectual attitude on one side, but also a distinguishable Balkan-flavoured humour and macho camp on the other. He often, if not always used rap music combined with folk music parody and political and social satire, although he doesn't fit into the conventional rap music category because he went beyond the style. He is also famous for coining the term ""turbo folk"", though he was one of its greatest enemies. He is still a cult personality in the ex-Yugoslav territories.          He often closely cooperated with another musician, Dino Dvornik, the son of the famous Croatian actor Boris Dvornik. Dino Dvornik was a popular funk-inspired dance-pop artist.          Two years after the group Riva won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1989 and one year after the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 took place in Zagreb, the SFR Yugoslav music scene ceased to exist with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Ironically, the 1990 winning song performed by Toto Cutugno was called (in Italian: Together in 1992) featuring the lyrics ""Together, Unite, Unite Europe!"" acclaiming the approaching European unification that took place in 1992.          Tajči became one of the last breakout pop stars in Yugoslavia, before the disintegration of the country cut her career short and she emigrated to the United States.          With the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars many of the former Yugoslav musicians participated in anti-war activities, often being attacked by the nationalists in their countries. In 1992, the serbian rock supergroup Rimtutituki featuring members of Partibrejkers, Ekatarina Velika and Električni Orgazam released an anti-militarist song, and after the authorities forbade them to promote it with a live show, they performed on a trailer towed by a truck through the streets of Belgrade. However, others previously involved in the Yugoslav pop and rock scene embraced national chauvinism, and even saw active combat.          Notable example is the case of the song ""E, moj druže Beogradski"" (""Hey my Belgrade comrade""). Although generally seen as an emotional anti-war song pointed against the Serbian nationalism written by Jura Stublić from the Croatian group Film, at the time of its appearance it caused different reactions. Bora Đorđević, who had a cult status in the Serbian rock scene as a frontman of Riblja Čorba, soon ""replied"" with the controversial song ""E moj druže Zagrebački"" (""Hey my Zagreb comrade""), a cynical parody featuring nationalist messages.          Many Croatian pop and rock artists took part in projects such as ""Moja domovina"" and Rock za Hrvatsku during the Croatian War of Independence.          When the Bosnian War broke out, the Sarajevo based group Zabranjeno Pušenje split into two separate fractions. The latter based itself in Belgrade and received international exposure under the name No Smoking Orchestra led by Nele Karajlić, also featuring the movie director Emir Kusturica. They played with Joe Strummer and that concert footage is included in the ""Super 8 Stories"" film directed by Kusturica.          While Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia proclaimed themselves independent states, the leaderships of Serbia and Montenegro decided to form a new federal state called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which existed from 1992 until 2003, however it was not recognized as a legal successor to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.          The local scenes in the independent countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia continued to exist, some of them heavily suffering during the war. The music scene continued even in the shelters during the Sarajevo siege and a compilation album ""Rock under siege"" (Radio Zid Sarajevo, Stichting Popmuziek Nederland) was released in 1995.          After the end of the conflicts and especially later, after the departure of the nationalist leaders such as Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tuđman, the former Yugoslav nations started to normalise their relations. Thus their music scenes could freely restore their former cooperation. Many of the former pop and rock stars re-emerged and toured the former Yugoslav countries: Bijelo Dugme, Leb i Sol, Crvena Jabuka, Plavi Orkestar, Massimo Savić (formerly of Dorian Gray) and Boris Novković (formerly of the group Boris i Noćna Straža), while Anja Rupel, formerly of Videosex, recorded a duet with Toše Proeski, a young Macedonian pop singer who became respected in all the former Yugoslav countries.          Following the reconciliation of Serbia and Croatia, the afforementioned Croatian musician Jura Stublić held three sold out concerts in Belgrade in 2003. Asked by the media about ""E, moj druže Zagrebački"" case, Bora Đorđević replied that ""it was just a joke"" . He also expressed approbation for the Jura Stublić's comeback to Belgrade after so many years. On the other hand, Bajaga and Đorđe Balašević had respectively made numerous concert appearances in Croatia and Bosnia.          In 2003 Igor Mirković from Croatia made the rockumentary ""Sretno dijete"" (""Happy Child"") named after a song by Prljavo Kazalište. The movie covers the early Yugoslav Punk and Yugoslav new wave scene featuring eminent artists from Zagreb, Ljubljana and Belgrade.          Many eminent former Yugoslav Pop and Rock artists composed children's music, mostly educational. The SFR Yugoslav system through its media encouraged children to practise the traditional folk music and dances, as well as to listen to pop and rock music, contrary to the kitschy ""novokomponovana narodna muzika"".","['Bosnia and Herzegovina music', 'Croatian music history', 'Culture of Vojvodina', 'Kosovar music', 'Macedonian music', 'Montenegrin music', 'Music history of Slovenia', 'Serbian music', 'Yugoslav music', 'Yugoslav rock']"

11505299,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11505299,Jon Boden,"Jon Boden is a singer, composer and musician, best known as lead singer and main arranger of Bellowhead. His first instrument is the fiddle and he is a leading proponent of ""English traditional fiddle style"" and also of ""fiddle singing"", both of which he employs in Bellowhead, in the duo Spiers & Boden, and previously as a member of Eliza Carthy’s Ratcatchers.          To date Jon Boden has been the recipient of 11 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, more than any other musician.          Boden also fronts his own band the Remnant Kings, put together in 2009 to perform his post-apocalyptic song cycle ""Songs From The Floodplain"". He has also made contributions to many other albums as a fiddler, singer and guitarist, most notably two albums with Fay Hield & The Hurricane Party.          In 2010 he launched an ambitious project to record and deliver A Folk Song A Day on line, aiming to inspire others to build a repertoire of songs and engage in social singing. All 365 songs are now available on iTunes, Spotify and YouTube, as well as on the www.afolksongaday.com website.          Boden holds a master's degree in Musical Theatre and has worked on numerous, prestigious theatrical productions, including two plays with the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2012 Jon was commissioned to create a stage show based on ""The Ballad Of Little Musgrave And Lady Barnard"" as part of the Benjamin Britten centenary celebrations.          As a composer Boden’s output has grown increasingly diverse, crossing over into classical, choral, dance, pop, film and television.          Boden was born in Chicago in 1977 but grew up in Winchester, England, where he attended Henry Beaufort School and Peter Symonds College. He has a BA in Medieval Studies from Durham University and a master's degree in Composition for Musical Theatre from the London College of Music.          He first started writing for the stage along with friend Chris T-T when still at school and he wrote his first musical whilst at sixth-form college. At Durham University he composed music for a number of plays and wrote a musical for his college. Whilst at Durham he met Ben Naylor who subsequently went on to become a successful theatre director and with whom Boden has worked many times since.          Alongside his performing career Boden has continued to work in theatre, most notably with the RSC.          When Jon Boden first met John Spiers in the Elm Tree pub in Oxford, Boden had little experience of folk clubs having played exclusively in pub sessions up to that point. The duo quickly established common ground and started playing together, soon establishing themselves on the live folk club circuit. They were signed by Fellside Records and their debut album ""Through & Through"" was released in 2001. The following year they toured with Eliza Carthy as part of her Ratcatchers band.          They released three further albums for Fellside, ""Bellow"" in 2003 and the companion discs, ""Songs"" and ""Tunes"" both released in 2005. Spiers & Boden then signed to Navigator Records releasing the themed ""Vagabond"" in 2008 and retrospective album ""The Works"" in 2011. The latter marked their 10th anniversary as a recording duo. They toured that year and collaborators from ""The Works"" joined them on stage, with a finale at London’s Shepherds Bush Empire featuring many guests.          In Spring 2013, Spiers & Boden undertook the innovative Backyard Songs tour, playing material relevant to each show’s locality and inviting audiences to contribute local songs, dances and folklore. Their farewell tour was announced the following year in March and May 2014 and the duo’s activities were put on hold.          Boden plays fiddle and sings lead vocal in Spiers & Boden. He was the first person to use a ""stomp box"" with English traditional music (a large wooden box containing a microphone and made to sound like a kick drum) - an idea he and Spiers borrowed from singer-songwriter Rory McCleod. Boden also plays acoustic guitar in Spiers & Boden employing a percussive finger style reminiscent of Nic Jones and Martin Simpson, but using the highly unusual tuning of CEBEBE.          The folk big band was famously conceived by Spiers & Boden whilst stuck in traffic en route to playing a gig in Essex. Initially conceived as a way to take the duo’s show to the bigger stages and festivals, John and Jon approached a wish list of friends and musical associates as well as leading session players from the world music and jazz scenes, with the idea of starting an English equivalent of the Canadian band La Bottine Souriante. Initially, Boden arranged and orchestrated an hour’s worth of material for the 10 piece band, all based on existing Spiers & Boden material, in time for Bellowhead's debut at that the 2004 Oxford Folk Festival. This was swiftly followed by recording the five track ""E.P. Onymous"", which they released independently.          Adding sousaphone player Gideon Juckes to the lineup in 2005, the band then signed to German label Westpark Music and recorded their debut full-length album ""Burlesque"". These first two releases established Boden as the principal arranger for Bellowhead. He has continued in that role, arranging around two-thirds of all the songs Bellowhead have recorded to date.          Bellowhead subsequently signed to Navigator records recording ""Matachin"" in 2008 and releasing a further two albums (""Hedonism"" in 2010 followed by ""Broadside"" in 2012, both of which, reached Silver Disc status in the UK) before signing to Island Records in 2014 and releasing ""Revival"". Upon release ""Revival"" charted at number 12 in the UK album charts.          Bellowhead have had a total of seven singles 'playlisted' by BBC Radio 2, all but one of which were arranged by Boden.          Recent tours have seen an increasing number of after show sessions, taking place in pubs local to the venues (see The Remnant Kings below).          Boden has released two solo albums. ""Painted Lady"" in 2006 released on Jon’s own Soundpost Records and ""Songs From The Floodplain"" in 2009, released by Navigator Records.          ""Painted Lady"" was produced by Jon and Ben Ivitsky and it feature 12 songs written by Boden. The record was also notable for the fact that Boden played every instrument including fiddle, octave fiddle, concertina, banjo, guitars, double bass, drums, Indian harmonium, glockenspiel, electric piano, and more unusually for a folk artist, Moog synthesiser and drum machine. Fay Hield is the only other contributor singing backing vocals on one song.          ""Songs From The Floodplain"" is a post-apocalyptic song cycle, all 12 songs written by Boden. The album was produced by Boden with Keith Angel and again Jon plays all instruments. It is a concept album based on a dystopian future after some unnamed apocalypse finds a cast of characters reverting to traditional rituals and ceremonies, while trying to make sense of their survival. A play based on the song cycle is currently in development by playwright Barney Norris.          Boden toured ""Songs From The Floodplain"" several times with The Remnant Kings. The show mixes in selections from A Folk Song A Day that loosely fit the dystopian theme, Painted Lady and other cover versions. The stage show is also notable for its use of phonograph wax cylinder players. The band is made up of multi-instrumentalists and includes Bellowhead cohorts Sam Sweeney (on fiddle, concertina, glass harmonica and drums) and Paul Sartin (on fiddle and oboe) with Rob Harbron (concertina, fiddle, banjo and guitar) and Rick Foot on bass. Live, Boden plays guitar, electric guitar, fiddle, melodeon and concertina and sings lead on all songs.          As Boden explained in this BBC Radio 3 essay, he views the prospect of a post-industrial world without gas or oil as sitting in harmony with the relevance of folk music and social singing.          Remnant King gigs were also notable for singing sessions organised after the show, either within the venues or at nearby pubs. This saw the band congregate around a table with various audience members, all singing folk songs unaccompanied.          The idea was later developed with Bellowhead with the band engaging in regular after show sessions on their tours. Boden discussed the importance of these events in this key-note speech for the English Folk Expo in 2014.          The stated aim of A Folk Song A Day was to post a traditional folksong onto the site, every day for a year. The site grew into an active blog with a lively community exploring the history and roots of the music, but was primarily intended to promote the art of social singing by giving people access to an expansive repertoire of traditional tunes.          Many of the songs were recorded with no accompaniment, but Boden used fiddle, concertina and guitar in some cases. Most were also performed solo, although he had occasional guest singers, notably Fay Hield and several extra voices on some of the carols that were the focus for December, based on the Sheffield tradition at Dungworth.          The project was supported with the release of 12 monthly digital albums, making all of the content available for download and ownership.          A recurring theme in Boden’s work is the social aspect of folksong and folk tunes and the idea that the folk tradition is a common heritage that belongs to all. It’s a theme he’s returned to again and again, notably with Spiers & Boden’s Backyard Tour (which included music relevant to the towns that they played) and in post gig sessions that have happened in bars and pubs after many shows, including the Bellowhead tour of November 2014.          As recently as October 2014 Jon used the theme as the main inspiration for his keynote address at The Folk Expo in Bury. He explored both the role of the folk singer as professional, but also suggested that there needs to be a balance between performance and participation.          At the start of 2013 Jon was commissioned by Jonathan Reckie, the musical director of Aldeburgh Music to create the show based on Britten’s ""The Ballad Of Little Musgrave And Lady Barnard"". It was part of a much wider global programme of events to celebrate Britten’s centenary, straddling the worlds of folk music, theatre and classical composition. The resulting piece used Britten’s setting of the ballad for male voice choir, interspersed with five ‘interpolations’ composed by Boden, with lyrics co-written by him and Mary Hampton. The soloists were Mary Hampton, Tim van Eyken, Rob Habron, James Findlay and The Peterborough Male Voice Choir. The production was directed by David Edwards and was staged at Snape Maltings Aldeburgh, Peterborough Cathedral and The Sage, Gateshead.          In 2013 Boden joined the Sacconi Quartet to perform Elvis Costello and the Brodski Quartet’s Juliet Letters at The Bristol Proms. In 2015 they performed the piece again at The Sacconi Quartet’s own Chamber Music Festival in Folkstone, with a performance scheduled for Lichfield Cathedral in July 2015 as part of the city’s annual festival.          In film and television Jon has written the soundtrack for the BBC TV version of the successful radio comedy Count Arthur Strong. Boden also contributed a version of Mike Scott’s ""How Long Will I Love You"" to the soundtrack of the Richard Curtis’ feature film ""About Time"", appearing as a busker in an extended montage sequence. Boden’s version of the song plays at the end of the film.          Boden composed ""All Hallows"" for Music to Move to, a part of the annual Dance Umbrella, London’s international dance festival, celebrating 21st century choreography across the capital and running since 1978. It was a commission from Fuel Theatre and the piece was used to create two videos, the first capture a performance from professional choreographer Vicki Igbokwe, the second a montage of footage from the public, who were encouraged to film their own response to the piece.          Boden has been commissioned to compose a short choral piece for The Bristol Proms 2015, to be performed at Bristol Old Vic Theatre by Erebus Ensemble, a 40 piece choir.","['English fiddlers', 'English folk musicians', '1977 births', 'Living people', 'English folk singers', 'Musicians from Chicago, Illinois', 'American emigrants to England', 'People from Winchester', 'Alumni of the University of West London']"

426500,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=426500,Kevin Millwood,"Kevin Austin Millwood (born December 24, 1974) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies and Seattle Mariners.          While with the Braves, Millwood was part of a pitching rotation which featured Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. In 1999 he was selected to his only All-Star Game and helped the Braves to the 1999 World Series and two seasons later the 2001 National League Championship Series. As a member of the Indians, his 2.86 ERA lead all American League pitchers. In 2012, Millwood became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 career strikeouts.          Millwood graduated from Bessemer City High School in North Carolina. He has a           League ballpark named for him in Bessemer City. Millwood was married to Rena Stevens Millwood from 1999–2008 and had 2 children from that marriage.           Millwood was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 11th round of the 1993 MLB draft. After four years in the minors, Millwood made his debut with the Atlanta Braves on July 14, 1997. A year later, he won 17 games. Millwood formed a part of the Braves' star pitching rotation, which also consisted of Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. According to Nate Silver, the 1997 Braves starting rotation was the best in the history of baseball.          The 1999 campaign was one of Millwood's best. He posted career-highs in wins (18, also achieved in 2002), ERA (2.68), strikeouts (205) and WHIP (0.996). He finished third in the National League Cy Young voting (losing to the Arizona Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson) and 26th on the National League MVP ballot. He was selected as an All-Star in 1999, his only appearance in the Midsummer Classic.          Before the 2003 season, Millwood was traded by the Braves to the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher Johnny Estrada in order to cut their payroll in the midst of economic difficulties. He went 14-12 with his new team, including throwing a no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on April 27 coming in the Phillies final season at the stadium. This was one of only two no-hitters ever thrown at the now-demolished Veterans Stadium. He also led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 41.          In 2005, Millwood signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians. He came back from injury well, leading the American League in ERA (2.86). However, he managed a record of only 9-11, due to poor run support. During 2005, he again led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 33. He was tied for 6th in the balloting for the AL Cy Young Award.          On December 26, 2005, the Texas Rangers signed Millwood to a five-year, $60 million deal.          In 2006, he and Vicente Padilla won 15 games; a total not matched by a Rangers pitcher until Scott Feldman in 2009.          In 2008, when batters did hit the ball against him, it was with uncommon success, as his .358 batting-average-against on balls in play was the highest in the major leagues. 26% of all balls put in play against him were line drives, the highest percentage in the majors.          Millwood was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on December 9, 2009, for Chris Ray and a player to be named later (left-handed pitcher Ben Snyder, a Rule 5 pick from San Francisco).          During the 2010 season, Millwood went 4-16 with a 5.10 earned run average, leading the league in losses.          On March 25, 2011, Millwood was signed to a minor league contract by the New York Yankees. After making three starts in the minor leagues, he opted out of his contract on May 1.          Millwood signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox on May 19, 2011. He was released on August 7, exercising an opt-out clause.          On August 8, 2011, Millwood signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. Millwood was called up August 10 to fill a void after an injury to Juan Nicasio.          On January 22, 2012, it was reported that the Seattle Mariners had signed Millwood to a minor league contract. He was called up from Triple-A and made his first major league start of the season on April 22 against the Chicago White Sox. On May 13, Millwood became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 career strikeouts when he struck out Yankee Curtis Granderson. Millwood notched a win over Yankee starter Andy Pettitte, who was pitching in the majors for the first time since 2010.          On June 8, Millwood pitched the first six innings of a combined no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers before leaving the game due to a groin injury. Charlie Furbush, Stephen Pryor, Lucas Luetge, Brandon League, and Tom Wilhelmsen helped him complete the bid. Millwood was put on the disabled list in September with soreness in his shoulder and missed the remainder of the regular season.          On February 3, 2013, Millwood was reported to be retiring.          Millwood is a sinkerballer. His sinker is 89–92 mph and is complemented mostly by an 89–91 mph cutter and 83–86 mph slider. He also has a curveball (71–74) and a changeup (82–84) that he uses against left-handed hitters. His cutter tends to be used early in the count, with higher use of his breaking balls in 2-strike situations.","['1974 births', 'Living people', 'Atlanta Braves players', 'Philadelphia Phillies players', 'Cleveland Indians players', 'Texas Rangers players', 'Baltimore Orioles players', 'Colorado Rockies players', 'Seattle Mariners players', 'American League ERA champions', 'Baseball players from North Carolina', 'Major League Baseball pitchers', 'National League All-Stars', 'Sportspeople from Atlanta, Georgia', 'People from Gastonia, North Carolina', 'Gulf Coast Braves players', 'Danville Braves players', 'Macon Braves players', 'Greenville Braves players', 'Durham Bulls players', 'Richmond Braves players', 'Frisco RoughRiders players', 'Trenton Thunder players', 'Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees players', 'Pawtucket Red Sox players']"

Like ShareData, American Game Cartridges was headquartered in Chandler, Arizona. AGC published three video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1990.          Prior to the founding of American Game Cartridges, ShareData hired Richard C. Frick as Vice President of Product Development. Frick worked previously at Atari Games, and had some experience with their console game subsidiary, Tengen. Tengen was one of several game developers who rejected the contract terms that Nintendo imposed on its licensees. Instead, such developers published unlicensed games that defeated the NES's lockout chip. Frick was acquainted with this strategy, and applied it at ShareData's new company, American Game Cartridges. To defeat the NES's lockout chip, called 10NES, AGC licensed technology from Color Dreams.          AGC also licensed two titles from arcade game manufacturer Exidy: ""Chiller"" (1986) and ""Death Race"" (1976), which they adapted to the NES in 1990. ""Chiller"" was AGC's first game release, and was also ShareData's first title for the NES. ""Death Race"" quickly followed, as did an original work called ""Shockwave"" (1990).          Keeping with ShareData's business model of producing low-cost video games, AGC attempted to undersell their competition by as much as 30%. However, debts mounted throughout 1991, and by the fourth quarter AGC's creditors were trying to force the company into a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States' Bankruptcy Code. ShareData itself was among the creditors pressuring American Game Cartridges, and American Game Cartridges filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 soon after. They remained in Chapter 11 until January 1994, when they finally filed their plan to reorganize.          Richard Frick left ShareData and American Game Cartridges amidst these difficulties, and started another unlicensed NES game development company called American Video Entertainment. Meanwhile, developer Keith Rupp of American Game Cartridges completed a fourth title, ""Wally Bear and the NO! Gang"", but AGC's financial difficulties preempted its release. Frick's new company secured the rights to the game, and published it in 1992.          American Game Cartridges planned several other game releases, including a conversion of Exidy's ""Crossbow"" (1983), but was unable to complete development.","['Companies based in Chandler, Arizona', 'Companies established in 1990', 'Companies disestablished in 1994', 'Defunct video game companies', 'Video game companies of the United States', 'Video game development companies', 'Video game publishers']"

4278497,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4278497,As the World Falls Down,"""As the World Falls Down"" is a song written by David Bowie in 1986 for the soundtrack of the film ""Labyrinth"".          The song is the backdrop for an illusion which Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie) builds around Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) through the use of an enchanted peach. The illusion is of a masquerade ball inside a bubble. Sarah is the only character in this scene without a mask, though Jareth removes his mask earlier in the scene.          The scene coupled with the song has been interpreted many ways. Some believe that the illusion is an attempt by Jareth to win Sarah's love; others believe he is trying to seduce her to distract her from the 13-hour time limit she has to rescue her brother Toby. or the third choice that it could be a double intention, as in Jareth is trying to do both.          Yet another theory is that the crystal ball represents everything Sarah wants and what Jareth is promising her; endless parties, dancing, glamor, fame, attention from a King, beautiful friends and adoration from all. As the scene becomes more sinister and she sees things for what they really are, however, Sarah is overcome with the realization that the world of the crystal is superficial, frightening and bizarre and not what she wants after all. Jareth's professed love for Sarah may be, in fact, a trap to turn her into a goblin. It is with this realization that she smashes the crystal ball and returns to the world of the Labyrinth for Jareth's last attempt to divert Sarah from her goal of rescuing Toby before he is turned into a goblin.          Another theory is that Jareth represents adulthood. If Sarah goes with him and chooses to be with him she will be giving up her childhood.          A video for ""As the World Falls Down"" was mooted for a Christmas 1986 single release, with a 3:40 edit and a video made by Steve Barron. However, perhaps because Bowie did not want the love ballad to lessen the impact of his intention to have a harder-sounding release in ""Never Let Me Down"", the single release was cancelled. The music video was later included on the second disc of the ""Best of Bowie"" compilation DVD.          The music video includes new footage mixed with clips from the film. It begins by showing an older Sarah (Charlotte Valandrey) relaxing in an office as a photocopier prints multiple images of Jareth's face. Meanwhile, Jareth is seen performing the track in an elegant room with Hoggle as his sole companion. A portrait of Sarah hangs on the wall. At one point the portrait crashes to the ground, prompting Jareth and Hoggle to look to the door as they falsely believe there is someone on the other side. The doorway is empty, and Jareth is seen staring ahead grimly upon realizing no one was there. Both Sarah and Jareth appear to want to go to the other, although neither of them are willing to take the first step.","['David Bowie songs', '1986 songs', 'Songs written by David Bowie', 'Song recordings produced by David Bowie', 'Music videos directed by Steve Barron', 'Pop ballads']"

4870318,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4870318,Autocollimation,"Autocollimation is an optical setup where a collimated beam (of parallel light rays) leaves an optical system and is reflected back into the same system by a plane mirror.          It is used for measuring small tilting angles of the mirror, see autocollimator, or for testing the quality of the optical system or of a part of it. Large-aperture optics, however, are tested with a null corrector avoiding the production of a large plane mirror.          One special application is to determine the focal length of a diverging lens: A light source is placed at twice the focal length of a converging lens on one side and a screen at the same distance on the other side so that the image of the light source is the sharpest possible. When this is achieved, the screen is replaced with a mirror and the diverging lens is inserted between the converging lens and the light source at such a distance to the mirror that the light returning through the diverging and converging lenses produces a sharp image on top of the luminous object. This is the case when the beam hitting the mirror is collimated. The distance found is the (negative) focal length of the diverging lens.          Light from an origin point O is collimated (made parallel) by a high quality objective lens. If the collimated beam falls perpendicularly onto a plane reflecting surface, the light is reflected back along its original path and is brought to a focus at a point coincident with the origin point. If the reflector is tilted through an angle θ, the reflected beam is deflected through an angle 2θ, and the image I is displaced laterally from the origin 0.The amount of displacement is given by d=2θf where f is the focal length of the lens, and θ is in radians.          Light from an illuminated target graticule at the focus of an objective lens is directed towards the lens by a beam splitter. After reflection by a mirror on the workpiece, the light returns through the Autocollimator and passes through the beam splitter, forming an image of the target graticule in the plane of an eyepiece graticule. The eyepiece graticule and the reflected image of the target graticule are viewed simultaneously through the eyepiece.          The image of the target graticule is always seen in focus and at constant magnification in the eyepiece, regardless of the distance between the Autocollimator and the reflecting surface. However, at long working distances only a portion of the reflected target graticule may appear in the eyepiece, owing to the failure of obliquely returning rays to enter the Autocollimator. This will result in a restricted measuring range.",['Optical metrology']

The MPP refused to participate in the vote, and Saikhanbileg was elected by a vote of 42-2.          Saikhanbileg's major task as Prime Minister has been to improve foreign investment in Mongolia, which took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2013, when Rio Tinto halted expansion at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Ömnögovi Province. Foreign investment fell nearly 4 billion between 2012 and 2015. In 2015 Saikhanbileg called for a ""text-message referendum"", polling the country for their opinion on major mining projects. When asked if the country should try to get out of financial trouble by support mining projects through investment, or cut costs, approximately 56% supported investment.","['1969 births', 'Democratic Party (Mongolia) politicians', 'Government ministers of Mongolia', 'Living people', 'Members of the State Great Khural', 'People from Dornod Province', 'Prime Ministers of Mongolia', 'National University of Mongolia alumni']"

The title attributes to Nālukettu, a traditional ancestral home (""Taravad"") of a Nair joint family. Like many other novels written by MT, ""Naalukettu"" is also set against the backdrop of the crumbling matrilineal order of Kerala in a newly independent India.          ""Naalukettu"" remains a classic in Malayalam fiction. It contributed to the renewal of a literary tradition initiated by S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai and Uroob in the 1950s. It was given the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1959. It has had 23 reprints (as of 2008) and was translated into 14 languages and had a record sale of a half a million copies (as of 2008) and still features in the best-seller lists.          Doordarshan adapted the novel into a television film in 1995. Malayalam actor Krishnaprasad enacted the protagonist in this film. It won the Kerala State Television Award for the year 1996. A screenplay based on the novel was released on 8 December 2012 as part of the DC International Book Festival, Thiruvananthapuram.          ""Naalukettu"" is a veritable depiction of the matriarchal social order of Kerala's Nair community in its final gasp for life. The hero Appunni is a scion of a once rich and powerful family. Appunni is the son of a woman who married a man of her own choices and who did not marry the man whom her Karnavar suggested. So she has to leave the family with her son and Appunni grows up without a father and away from the prestige and protection of the matrilineal home to which he belongs. The novel captures the traumas and psychological graph of Appunni, an introvert and angry youth, aspiring to avenge the insult meted out to him in a matrilineal family by building a new edifice on the ruins of his ancestral home.          ""The Hindu""'s critic K. Kunhikrishnan comments: """"Naalukettu"" was significant in that it fascinatingly portrayed the degeneration of the matrilineal system of joint families (tharawad), where large numbers of relatives lived together. The decline and collapse of the system resulted in nuclear families and consequential social, traditional and economic changes. But apart from the historical angle, ""Naalukettu"" has a lasting literary value, as one of the best in Malayalam fiction.""

Of note, she served as Canada's captain in a gold-medal winning effort at the 2014 4 Nations Cup in Kamloops, British Columbia.          Irwin grew up playing boys hockey until she was 16 and was the first girl to make a AAA-level boys team in Thunder Bay, ON. After moving to women’s hockey, she made Canada's national Under-22 team. Irwin was part of the gold medal winning Ontario Red squad at the January 2005 National Women’s Under-18 Championship in Salmon Arm, B.C. Irwin won the PWHL championship and OWHA provincial championship in 2005 and 2006 with the Toronto Jr. Aeros.

University of Minnesota Duluth women's hockey coach and former Canadian Olympic coach Shannon Miller recruited Irwin for UMD. When Irwin arrived in the fall of 2007 for her first season with the Bulldogs, she came in with more of an offensive game. She was not killing penalties and there were issues with her off-ice training and her weight. Miller made her fill out training logs, journaling all her workouts and her meals.          For the 2007–08 season, Irwin led UMD and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) in scoring, was the league's Rookie of the Year and had the most points per game of any female U.S. college hockey player. For her effort, she was named WCHA Rookie of the Year and to the WCHA First All-Star, WCHA All-Rookie and WCHA All-Tournament teams.          She scored the game-winning goal to help UMD win the 2008 NCAA Division I national championship. The goal was vs. University of Wisconsin goaltender and Patty Kazmaier Award winner Jessie Vetter.

It has been referred to as Janáček's ""manifesto on love"".          The ""Intimate Letters"" quartet was the second to be composed after a request from the Bohemian Quartet who, in 1923, requested Janáček to compose two string quartets for them. Unusually for a classical work, the nickname ""Intimate Letters"" (""""Listy důvěrné"" in Czech) was given by the composer, as it was inspired by his long and spiritual friendship with Kamila Stösslová, a married woman 38 years his junior. The composition was intended to reflect the character of their relationship as revealed in more than 700 letters they exchanged with each other:          The première of the work took place on 11 September 1928, a month after Janáček died. The composition was performed by Moravian Quartet."".          It consists of four movements:          The viola assumes a prominent role throughout the composition, as this instrument is intended to personify Kamila. The viola part was originally written for a viola d'amore, however the conventional viola was substituted when Janáček found the viola d'amore did not match the texture. Milan Škampa of the Smetana Quartet has interpreted the third ""letter"", or movement, as a lullaby for the son that Janáček and Kamila Stösslová never had together.          The work is essentially tonal albeit not in the traditional sense. For example, the work closes with six D-flat major chords (Janáček's favourite chord), but with the added dissonance of an E-flat.","['Chamber music by Leo\xc5\xa1 Jan\xc3\xa1\xc4\x8dek', 'Compositions for string quartet', '1928 compositions']"

23705532,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23705532,The Heartbreaks,"The Heartbreaks are a British alternative rock band formed in Morecambe, Lancashire in 2009. The band consists of singer Matthew Whitehouse, songwriter and drummer Joseph Kondras, guitarist Ryan Wallace and bassist Christopher 'Deaks' Deakin.          The band formed in the seaside resort of Morecambe in 2009, brought together by a shared love of soul music, Orange Juice and gritty Northern literature. Before forming the band, Whitehouse and Kondras worked as ice cream men, Wallace was a roofer and Deakin ""just floated from place to place"". Whitehouse was the 2008–2009 North West's Under 21 Fastest Soft Serve Pourer. The competition was held in Skelmersdale, where he won £35 of WH Smith vouchers and a pair of monogrammed pouring gloves.          The band have been described as ""fanatical experts on the British seaside"", and many of their early rehearsals took place in an old snooker hall off the promenade. A few months after forming, the band were named ""Manchester Evening News"" Band of 2009.          In February 2010, the band were featured on a compilation EP released by independent label Fierce Panda, called ""Rip It Up"". Their inclusion, an early demo of song, ""Jealous, Don't You Know"", was given its first airplay by Steve Lamacq, who introduced it on his BBC Radio 6 Music show as ""Lipstick on Your Collar meets a juggernaut of guitars which veered off the motorway somewhere in the 1980s"". Lamacq would go on to describe a London Heartbreaks show around this time as ""like being at the infamous Sex Pistols show at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, June 1976"".          The Heartbreaks released their debut single, ""Liar, My Dear"", through Parlophone subsidiary Seven Sevens, in March 2010. Described as ""an achingly beautiful debut"" by ""The Independent"", it was followed by a second release on Fierce Panda in August 2010, ""I Didn't Think It Would Hurt To Think Of You"", and a tour with former Libertines frontman Carl Barat, who described them as ""the finest support band I think I've ever had"". A third single, ""Jealous Don't You Know"", was released through their own imprint, Morecambe Rock, on Tri-Tone/PIASUK in March 2011, and was later remixed by English synthpop duo Hurts. These early singles earned the band comparisons to The Smiths and Manic Street Preachers in the ""NME"", who would also describe The Heartbreaks as one of ""the most exciting bands in the UK today"".          Throughout 2011, The Heartbreaks supported both Morrissey and Hurts across Europe, and performed for Bono in Milan, Kitsuné in Paris and Burberry in New York, with Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey declaring, “I love their energy, effortless style and very British attitude”.          ""Funtimes"" was produced by Tristan Ivemy (Babyshambles, Frank Turner, The Holloways) with additional production from Joe Cross (Hurts, The Sound of Arrows) and the track ""Remorseful"" by Edwyn Collins and Sebastian Lewsley. It achieved notable success in Japan where lead single, ""Delay, Delay"", spent eight weeks in the Japan Hot 100, peaking at number nine in the chart. Delay, Delay was voted ""Track of 2012"" by readers of ""The Fly"", beating ""Pelican"" by The Maccabees with 6,000 votes. The Heartbreaks followed up Funtimes by releasing ""Polly"" as a single in September 2012 as well as a re-recorded version of ""Hand on Heart"", with strings arranged by James Banbury of The Auteurs, in February 2013.          After encountering the band in Morecambe, the co-editor of Crap Towns, Sam Jordison, wrote in The Independent about listening to ""Funtimes"", ""The music is bursting with energy, love and poison. Best of all, just about every song is about Morecambe. They have looked behind the grime and decline and found poetry. Suddenly, the town seems cool. The Heartbreaks point the way to a brighter future. It's even starting to seem like Morecambe's status as a Crap Town could be a thing of the past"".          In early April 2013, Edwyn Collins revealed in an interview with the NME that he would be releasing a co-written 7” single with the band entitled ""What Are You Doing, Fool?"" for Record Store Day 2013. The b-side to the release was a cover of Orange Juice song, 'Untitled Melody'.          On October 21, '¡No Pasarán!’, the first song to be taken from the band's then untitled second album, was made available to download for free from their official site. This was followed by two shows in London and Manchester, where tracks from the new album were performed live for the first time. The shows sold out in just a few hours.          In early March, the band announced via Twitter that their second album would be called ""We May Yet Stand A Chance"". Produced by Manic Street Preachers producer Dave Eringa, it is to be released in the UK on June 2nd, proceeded by the singles ""Hey, Hey Lover"" and ""Absolved"".          When asked what is new about the upcoming release, Whitehouse is quoted as saying, ""Oh, many things… Cowboy psychedelia, sleazy bar-room slide, dischordal white-noise wig-outs… It all feels like a natural transition though. Rather than a deliberate ‘change of direction’. Ultimately, we’ve committed to ideas more. Ideas were always inside us but that took seclusion from an increasingly gangrenous music scene to become focused and unforced"".","['British indie rock groups', 'People from Morecambe']"

He started his playing career at Portsmouth as a trainee in July 1988, but only made a handful of appearances in six years before moving to Barnet in 1994. At Barnet he became a regular starter making over 130 appearances in three seasons.          In June 1997, Exeter City manager Peter Fox paid £10,000 to bring Gale to St James Park, where he was again a regular starter before a series of injuries started to interrupt his career.          In August 2000, he moved on a free transfer to Havant & Waterlooville, where he made over 100 appearances in his first two seasons. He sustained a broken arm during a friendly in August 2003 and the repercussions kept him off the pitch for the whole of the 2003–04 season, eventually forcing his retirement from playing. In February 2004 he took up the position as David Leworthy's right-hand man and remained in the role under Ian Baird.

4162600,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4162600,Augustus Chapman Allen,"Augustus Chapman Allen (July 4, 1806 – January 11, 1864), along with his younger brother, John Kirby Allen, founded the City of Houston in the U.S. state of Texas. He was born on July 4, 1806, in Canaseraga Village, New York (the present day hamlet of Sullivan in the Town of Sullivan, New York), to Sarah (Chapman) and Roland Allen.          Not long after turning 17, Augustus graduated from the Polytechnic Institute at Chittenango, New York, and started teaching mathematics there. In 1827, he changed careers and resigned his professorship. He then went to work as bookkeeper for the H. and H. Canfield Company, New York. After two years, he and his brother John bought an interest in the business. In the summer of 1832, the Allen brothers left Canfield to move to Texas, where they settled in San Augustine. By June 1833, the brothers had moved to Nacogdoches.          The Allen brothers arrived first in Galveston, Texas, and then moved to the small town of Saint Augustine. In 1833, Allen and his brother associated with a group of entrepreneurs in Nacogdoches and started operating as land speculators.          Instead of joining the army when the Texas War of Independence started, Augustus and his brother engaged in the business of keeping supply channels open. At their own expense, they outfitted a ship, the ""Brutus"", for the purpose of protecting the Texas coast and assisting troops and supplies from the United States to arrive safely in Texas.          Nevertheless, some members of the Texas provisional government objected to the Allen brothers' activities, and rumors indicated they were engaged in privateering. In January 1836, they sold the ""Brutus"" to the Texas Navy, and it became only the second ship in the fledgling naval force. Augustus and John Allen continued to raise money and operate as receivers and dispensers of supplies and funds for the war effort without charge. In spite of the brothers' services, gossip and censure were aimed at the Allens because they were not in the armed services.          Financed by an inheritance received by Augustus's wife, Charlotte, on August 26, 1836, the Allen brothers purchased 6,600 acres (27 km²) along the Buffalo Bayou for $5,000, for the purpose of establishing a new city. At the suggestion of Charlotte, they named their townsite for the hero of the time, General Sam Houston.          In the years after his brother John's death in 1838, the Allen family grew apart and squabbled about the family's various businesses and finances, which had been somewhat commingled. These family disputes eventually led to Allen's separation from his wife in 1850.          Soon, Allen's health began to fail, and he decided to leave Houston, signing over to his wife, whom he had never divorced, most of what remained of his many enterprises. Augustus Allen relocated to Mexico to tend to his health and a new start in life.          In 1852, Augustus was appointed United States consul for the port of Tehuantepec on the Pacific Ocean, and in 1858 he was given the same position for the port of Minotitlán. These offices gave him control of the consular affairs of the United States for the entire Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a commercially important position.          Allen, in partnership with an Englishman named Welsh, developed an extensive private shipping business. He was never able to recover his health, however, and realized, in 1864, that he was critically ill. Augustus then closed his business and went to Washington, D.C. to resign his consulships. Soon after arriving there he contracted pneumonia, from which he would not recover.          Augustus Allen died on Monday, January 11, 1864 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Several Houston landmarks, including Allen Parkway and Allen Center, as well as Allen's Landing Park, immortalize Augustus and his brother, the city's two founders. <BR>          <BR>          ""New York Times"" (New York, NY), Fri., 15 Jan 1864, p. 5, c. 3 <BR>          ""New York Herald"" (New York, NY), Fri., 15 Jan 1864, p. 8, c. 3<BR>          <BR>          DIED - ALLEN - In Washington, D.C., on Monday, Jan. 11, Augustus C.

503915,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=503915,A Rush of Blood to the Head,"A Rush of Blood to the Head is the second studio album by British alternative rock band Coldplay. Released on 26 August 2002 in the UK through the label Parlophone, the album was produced by the band and British record producer Ken Nelson. Recording started after the band became popular worldwide with the release of their debut album, ""Parachutes"", and one of its singles in particular, ""Yellow"". The album makes greater use of electric guitar and piano than its predecessor.          The album was made available in August 2002, two months after its original planned release date. It was released on 27 August in the United States through Capitol Records. Capitol released a remastered version of the album in 2008 on a 180-gram vinyl record as part of the ""From the Capitol Vaults"" series. The album debuted and continued their huge commercial legacy, an ongoing pattern that began with ""Parachutes"" which made Coldplay one of the best-selling bands worldwide. It topped the UK Albums Chart upon its first week of release in the United Kingdom, and became the eighth biggest-selling album of the 21st century in the UK. The British Phonographic Industry has since certified the album 9× Platinum for its accumulated sales of over 2.8 million units in the UK and this album sold 20 million worldwide. The album spawned the hit singles ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"", and ""Clocks"". ""God Put a Smile upon Your Face"" was also released, but was significantly less successful.          ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" has been critically acclaimed, and the band won the 2003 Grammy for Best Alternative Album for the second year in a row, and the 2004 Grammy for Record of the Year for the song ""Clocks"". In 2012 it was ranked number 466 on ""Rolling Stone's"" 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was also voted the best album of all time by the listeners of BBC Radio 2 in a poll conducted in 2013.          The band started recording the album in London a week after the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their ""poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences"". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on ""Parachutes"". Vocalist Chris Martin said that once there they ""became obsessed with recording"". ""In My Place"" was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single ""because it was the song that made us want to do a second album. It kept us going and made us think we could still write songs"", following ""a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing"" three months after the success of ""Parachutes"".          The band wrote more than 20 songs for the album and some of those new tracks, including ""In My Place"" and ""Animals"", were performed live during the tours promoting ""Parachutes"". The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website.          During initial recording sessions in Liverpool, vocalist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland worked alone, and only on weekends. Each Monday, they would present the song ideas that they had developed to their bandmates. With ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" nearly completed, Martin went into the studio late one night and wrote a piano riff that he has stated ""just came out"". The band recognised that this early version of the song, that would become ""Clocks"", was special the first time Martin played it to them. Reasoning that it was too late to include the song on the album, they recorded a demo version and included it on a CD marked ""Songs for #3"", featuring unfinished tracks they intended to work on for their third studio album.          By June 2002, the band had completed ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"", but thought their output sounded ""rubbish"" and reached an agreement with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on ""Parachutes"". Martin has claimed that it would have been uninteresting: ""It would have shown that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not. For us, it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians."" Such ambitions put the band under strain: ""sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit"".          After headlining the 2002 Glastonbury Festival, Coldplay returned to the studio and worked on some tracks from the ""Songs for #3"" they had produced earlier. Phil Harvey, the band's manager, heard ""Clocks"" and urged them to rework it immediately: ""No, you must do that song now 'cause you're going on [in the lyrics] about urgency, and you're talking about keeping this song back. That doesn't make sense.""          The album cover for ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" was designed by photographer Sølve Sundsbø. Sundsbø had been hired by fashion magazine ""Dazed & Confused"" in the late 1990s to produce something with a ""technological feel, something all white"". As an artist, he tried to do ""stuff that hasn't been done before, which is virtually impossible""; he suggested taking shots using a three-dimensional scanning machine.          The model for the shot wore an all-white makeup because it produces the ""best results""; for the image, the model wore a twill-coloured cape. The computer could not read the colours so it was replaced with spikes, and the head in the image was chopped because the machine only scanned 30 centimetres. The editor of the magazine liked the image and eventually featured it in one of their publications. Martin saw the image in the magazine and approached Sundsbø for permission to use the image as the cover of ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". For the album's singles, Martin asked Sundsbø what he could do; the latter suggested scanning the head of each member of the band (Sundsbø also did artwork duties for the ""Live 2003"" home video).          The booklet contains only two photos; One with Coldplay in a location that was rumoured to be a forest, and one with the same band in the studio. The album cover was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of ""Classic Album Cover"" postage stamps issued in January 2010.          Recording the album after 11 September attacks gave the band a fresh perspective: ""The new songs are reflective of new attitudes. [They tell listeners] not to be frightened. Anybody can achieve whatever they want to."" Most of the song lyrics are about urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: ""Perhaps there's a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that's born from all the places we've been and the things we've experienced."" Martin has explained, in relation to the theme of urgency, that the album's title means ""doing something on impulse"". Several songs on the album are about relationships. These tracks are based on reality, but according to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: ""Songs are like fairy tales: they have a beginning and an end and you can make it all work perfectly. Real life doesn't work like that"".          The album includes ballads and acoustic songs featuring extensive use of guitar and piano. The U2-esque ""epic rock"" of the album's opening track ""Politik"", the piano-driven ""Clocks"", the loud guitars of ""A Whisper"" and the Crowded House-inspired guitar in ""Warning Sign"" were seen as an extension of the band's musical range. Chris Martin has stated that the album's title track is an homage to American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash, whom he considered one of ""the greatest ... men with just guitars"".          The song ""Green Eyes"" was written by Chris Martin for two people: an ""American friend"" and bandmate, Jonny Buckland.          Upon release, ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" received universal acclaim from contemporary critics. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised score of 80% based on 25 reviews. Many felt that it built upon their previous album, ""Parachutes"". Alexis Petridis of the newspaper ""The Guardian"" wrote that the band's ""new assurance is everywhere ... the timidity of ""Parachutes"" is nowhere to be found"". He concludes, ""It sounds like an album ready to take on the world, and win.""          Kelefa Sanneh of ""The New York Times"" praised the album, commenting that it is ""one of the year's best albums"" and describing it as ""sparser, stranger and even catchier than its predecessor"". ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's Rob Sheffield, said that """"A Rush of Blood to the Head"" is a nervier, edgier, thoroughly surprising album"", adding, ""where ""Parachutes"" was the clumsy diary of a high-strung kid, ""A Rush of Blood"" sounds more like a band with the confidence to test its own limits."" Ted Kessler of ""NME"" lauded the album, calling it ""an album of outstanding natural beauty, an organic, wholesome work."" MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic echoed the above comments, saying that it is a ""strong album"". Wilson, who compliments Martin for his ""sharpened"" falsetto and refined ""haunting delivery"" and Buckland for his ""riveting guitar work"", notes that ""regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record"". Emma Pearse of the American newspaper ""The Village Voice"" has the same sentiments, stating that it is ""a little edgier, trancier, and more conversational"" compared to ""Parachutes"". Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honourable mention () and quipped, ""Let Green Eyes dump him for real and we'll see how long he hums in the void.""          ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" made an entrance into the UK Albums Chart upon its debut week, entering at number 1 and moving 273,924 copies. The British Phonographic Industry has since certified the album eight times platinum for its accumulated sales of over 2.4 million copies.

Gershenfeld (born 1959 or 1960) is an American professor at MIT and the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms, a sister lab to the MIT Media Lab. His research studies are predominantly focused in interdisciplinary studies involving physics and computer science, in such fields as quantum computing, nanotechnology, and personal fabrication. Gershenfeld attended Swarthmore College, where he graduated in 1981 with a B.A. degree in physics with high honors, and Cornell University, where he earned his Ph.D.in physics in 1990. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. ""Scientific American"" has named Gershenfeld one of their ""Scientific American 50"" for 2004 and has also named him Communications Research Leader of the Year. Gershenfeld is also known for releasing the ""Great Invention Kit"" in 2008, a construction set that users can manipulate to create various objects.          Gershenfeld has been featured in a variety of newspapers and magazines such as ""The New York Times"" and ""The Economist"", and on NPR.          He was named as one of the 40 modern-day Leonardos by the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago. ""Prospect"" named him as one of the top 100 public intellectuals.          In 1998, Gershenfeld started a class at MIT called ""How to make (almost) anything"". Gershenfeld wanted to introduce expensive, industrial-size machines to the technical students. However, this class attracted a lot of students from various backgrounds: artists, architects, designers, students without any technical background. In his interview to CNN, Gershenfeld said that ""the students... were answering a question I didn't ask, which is: What is this stuff good for? And the answer is: Not to make what you can buy in stores, but to make what you can't buy in stores. It's to personalise fabrication"". Gershenfeld believes that this is the beginning of a new revolution: digital revolution in fabrication that will allow people to fabricate things, machines on demand.          Gershenfeld has presented his course on ""How to make (almost) anything"" at the Association of Professional Model Makers (APMM) 2010 Conference.          This class later has led Gershenfeld to create Fab lab in collaboration with Bakhtiar Mikhak at MIT. Gershenfeld feels very passionate about this project, as he believes that teaching kids how to use technology and create it themselves will empower the future generations to become more independent and create technology that each individual community needs, not a technology that is currently available on the market. Fab labs have spread around the world, having been established in the remotest of places and countries. In his interview with ""Discover magazine"" on the question what personal fabrication might be useful for, Gershenfeld said, ""There is a surprising need for emergent technologies in many of the least developed places on the planet. While our needs might be fairly well met, there are billions of people on the planet whose needs are not. Their problems don't need incremental tweaks in current technology, but a revolution"".          As well as ""How to make (almost) anything"" class, Gershenfeld has started teaching the following classes: ""How To Make Something That Makes (almost) Anything"", ""The Physics of Information Technology"", ""The Nature of Mathematical Modeling"".          Neil Gershenfeld and his students have done an extensive amount of research. His research was published in Science (journal) as well as in The American Physical Society journal. Amongst many is the research on Experimental Implementation of Fast Quantum Searching, Microfluidic Bubble Logic research, Physical one-way functions.","['Year of birth missing (living people)', 'Living people', 'American physicists', 'Harvard Fellows', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty', 'Cornell University alumni', 'Swarthmore College alumni']"

He was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, and has worked on dozens of United States Congressional and Senatorial races. In 1998 he moved to Israel to serve as a consultant to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, became his chief of staff, and afterwards formed a partnership with political consultant Arthur Finkelstein.          He was a staffer at a national Republican Party committee in a United States election cycle, and worked more than a dozen international campaigns. His work includes polling, strategy, paid media and grassroots coalition building, developing and implementing campaign strategies.          Birnbaum took his first paid position in a political campaign in 1992, signing onto Ohio Republican Congressman Bob McEwen’s reelection campaign. In the years following, he worked on more congressional races, including campaigns in North Carolina, Florida and Virginia.          During the 1996 cycle, Birnbaum served as the deputy political director and director of survey research under National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato. Birnbaum worked on two dozen races in an election where Republicans broke the historical pattern and won two seats in the U.S. Senate. Following the 1996 cycle, Birnbaum managed Charlie Crist’s 1998 unsuccessful challenger campaign against incumbent Senator Bob Graham in Florida.          It was after the 1998 cycle that Birnbaum consulted for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s campaign. Birnbaum served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff, a position he held for a year and a half.          After serving Prime Minister Netanyahu, Birnbaum took a hiatus from political work, spending the next two years concentrating on international philanthropy and charitable work. In 2003, Birnbaum went into partnership with American conservative political consultant Arthur Finkelstein.          Since then, the two have consulted and managed campaigns throughout Europe and the Middle East, including the successful campaigns of Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon, Chancellor of Austria Alfred Gusenbauer, Prime Minister of Bulgaria Sergei Stanishev, Prime Minister of Romania Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, Prime Minister of Kosovo Hashim Thaçi, and President of Serbia Boris Tadic. In 2008, they worked to elect Nir Barkat as mayor of Jerusalem, and in 2009 they helped Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party become the third largest party in Israel – a position of strength which resulted in Mr. Lieberman’s ascension to the position of Foreign Minister in Prime Minister Netanyahu’s cabinet.","['American political consultants', 'Living people']"

Chu Chu Ramirez (Ricardo Montalban), a farm laborer from Mexico who works as a grape picker in California, has recently become an American citizen and is determined to better himself. While his cousin Manuel and his friends Celestino and Willie spend their pay on gambling and women, Chu Chu buys new clothes and an encyclopedia. When grape season ends, Chu Chu takes a job clearing land for Ansel Ames (Wendell Corey) on Ames' farm near Sacramento. Ames and his wife (Claire Trevor) are having marital problems and the lonely Mrs. Ames, who initially regards Chu Chu with contempt as a ""foreigner"", becomes attracted to Chu Chu over time. Chu Chu is friendly and kind to her, but does not return her affections and rejects her attempt to seduce him. Instead, Chu Chu is drawn to Nancy (Shelley Winters), a troubled waitress with a drinking problem whose former husband, a test pilot, was killed in a crash. Chu Chu puts up his prized possession, a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to get money for Nancy, and asks her to be his girl, although she protests that he shouldn't waste his time on a ""wino"" like herself.           Meanwhile Chu Chu has finished his work for Ames and receives his paycheck, but when Chu Chu goes to cash the check, the bank refuses payment. When Chu Chu confronts Ames about the bad check, Ames threatens him with a shotgun. Chu Chu brings the matter before a labor board and is promised his pay within sixty days. He plans to find Nancy, who has moved to Los Angeles, and marry her as soon as he receives his pay. However, at the end of the sixty days, when Chu Chu again attempts to collect his pay from Ames, Ames attacks him, causing Chu Chu to knock him down and leave. Ames and his wife then argue and Mrs. Ames tells her husband that Chu Chu is worth ten of him, causing Ames to hit her. She falls into a gun rack and a gun goes off, striking Ames in the shoulder. The Ameses falsely accuse Chu Chu of shooting Ames and he is arrested. After learning that Nancy has attempted suicide in Los Angeles, Chu Chu escapes from jail to rush to her side; they are briefly reunited but police soon find Chu Chu and take him back into custody.          At Chu Chu's trial, both Ames and Mrs. Ames repeat the false claim that Chu Chu shot Ames, and he is found guilty, although the jury requests and the judge grants a light sentence. Nevertheless, Chu Chu will lose his citizenship for being a convict, something he considers a ""fate worse than death"". Feeling that injustice has been done, Chu Chu's cousin and friends camp just outside the Ames property, staring at the Ameses, playing Mexican songs and doing other things that constantly remind the Ameses of Chu Chu. Nancy, who is still ill, arrives and accuses Mrs. Ames of destroying Chu Chu before collapsing and being rushed to the hospital. The Ameses attempt to reconcile with each other and realize they must tell the truth, that Chu Chu did not shoot Ames, even though they will be charged with perjury. Following their confession, Chu Chu is released and reunites with Nancy at the hospital.

He is considered a ""pioneer of FM rock,"" who played an important role in the progressive rock era of FM broadcasting. He was the first person to host a rock music show on New York City's FM band, commencing November 21, 1964 on WFUV. By broadcasting progressive rock and long album tracks, he was noted for introducing a musical alternative to Top 40 AM radio in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ""Billboard"" called his station ""a legend, affecting and inspiring people throughout the industry.""          He gave early exposure to country-rock bands like Buffalo Springfield and Poco, and did one of the first American interviews with Elton John. In 1991 he was co-host of ""Paul Simon Live in Central Park"" and was often called to be an expert guest commentator on PBS specials, including those featuring Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Roy Orbison, Peter, Paul and Mary, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor and others.          Starting with WOR-FM in 1966, FM was demonstrating a large rift from AM broadcasting. Fornatale was a key figure in this trend with his weekly program, ""Campus Caravan,"" which was heard on Fordham University's WFUV from 1964 to 1970. He began professionally in 1969 at WNEW-FM and also worked at WXRK (née WKTU). He returned to WFUV in 2001 and was heard weekly on his shows, ""Mixed Bag"" and ""Mixed Bag Radio,"" which is also on XM satellite radio. He won the Armstrong Excellence in Broadcasting Award in 1983. Mr. Fornatale received AFTRA's Media & Entertainment Excellence Award in February 2012 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.          He was a native of the Belmont section of the Bronx and attended Fordham Preparatory School and Fordham University, where he received a B.A. in Communication Arts in 1967. He was a member of the board of World Hunger Year.          Fornatale wrote several books, including ""The Rock Music Source Book,"" ""Radio in the Television Age,"" ""The Story of Rock 'n' Roll,"" and ""All You Need Is Love."" He was also helped write ""The Elvis Collection"" trading card series. In addition, he has written many feature shows for radio and television about Rock, including the syndicated ""Rock Calendar,"" episodes of ""MTV""'s ""Rock Influences,"" and the international television series ""Deja View."" His latest book is ""Back to the Garden: The Story of Woodstock.""          He hosted rock-related programs on WNET, PBS's station in New York City, and was an on-air consultant for rock music shows and specials on VH1, MTV and HBO.          In June 2010, Fornatale joined the crew of The Voice of Peace Network with his show ""Back To The Garden"" in support of WhyHunger.org. His show features Pete reflecting on some of his favorite friends and musicians.          In the summer of 2011, Fornatale toured the Northeast with two different multimedia programs to support his most recent book releases. The show titled ""Back to the Garden: The Story of Woodstock"" focused on Fornatale's experiences as an on-air personality during that period, and it is highlighted by Woodstock-related anecdotes based on events that occurred throughout the DJ's lengthy career as an interviewer, DJ and author. The program titled ""How Terribly Strange to be 70"" looked at the tumultuous history of Simon & Garfunkel, beginning with their early years when they performed as the duo 'Tom and Jerry'. He was working on a book on the Rolling Stones at the time of his death.          Mr. Fornatale died at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City at age 66 on April 26, 2012.

300148,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300148,Alhamdulillah,"Al-ḥamdu lillāh () or alḥamdulillāh is an Arabic phrase meaning ""Praise be to God"". It is frequently used by Muslims of every background, due to its centrality to the texts of the Quran and the words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, but also spoken by some Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews.          The meaning and in-depth explanation of the phrase have been the subject of much exegesis.          The phrase has three basic parts:          The word ""Allah"" is itself the fusion of the definite article al (the) and the word ilah (a god, deity). Like in English, the article is used here to single out the noun as being the only one of its kind, ""the god"" (the one and only) or ""God"" with a capital G (the concept of capital letters does not exist in Arabic). Therefore, ""Allah"" is the Arabic word for ""God"". ""ilāh"" is the Arabic cognate of the ancient Semitic name for God, El.          The phrase is first found in the second verse of the first sura of the Qur'an (Al-Fatiha). So frequently do Muslims and Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians invoke this phrase that the quadriliteral verb ""hamdala"" (حمدل), ""to say al-Hamdu li-'llah"" was coined, and the derived noun ""hamdalah"" (حمدلة) is used as a name for this phrase.          On any occasion and in any situation when Muslims desire to praise God, they may say: ""Alhamdulillah"" (الحمد لله).          The triconsonantal root Ḥ-M-D (ح م د), meaning ""praise,"" can also be found in the names Muhammad, Mahmud, Hamid and Ahmad.          English translations of ""Alhamdulillah"" include:           Jabir ibn Abd-Allah wrote in a hadith that Muhammad, said: ""The best remembrance of God is to repeat La ilaha ilallah and the best prayer (du'a) is Alhamdulillah (all praise belongs to God)."" (Narrated by Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Hakim who declared its chain 'sound'.)          Abu Huraira wrote that Muhammad said: ""Any matter of importance which is not begun with Alhumdulillah remains defective."" From Abu Dawood          Anas bin Malik wrote that Muhammad said: ""God is pleased with his slave who says, 'Alhumdulillah' when he takes a morsel of food and drinks a draught of water.""","['Arabic words and phrases', 'Islamic terminology', 'Gratitude']"
85538,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85538,Ops,"In ancient Roman religion, Ops or Opis (Latin: ""Plenty"") was a fertility deity and earth-goddess of Sabine origin.          In Ops' statues and coins, she is figured sitting down, as Chthonian deities normally are, and generally holds a scepter or a corn spike as her main attributes. The husband of Ops was Saturn.          In Roman mythology, and in Greek mythology where Ops is identified as Rhea, her husband was Cronus, the bountiful monarch of the Golden Age. Cronus was Rhea's husband and brother.          In Latin writings of the time, the singular nominative (""Ops"") is not used; only the form ""Opis"" is attested by classical authors. According to Festus (203:19), ""Ops is said to be the wife of Saturn and the daughter of Caelus. By her they designated the earth, because the earth distributes all goods to the human genus"" (""""). The Latin word ""ops"" means ""riches, goods, abundance, gifts, munificence, plenty"". The word is also related to ""opus"", which means ""work"", particularly in the sense of ""working the earth, ploughing, sowing"". This activity was deemed sacred, and was often attended by religious rituals intended to obtain the good will of chthonic deities such as Ops and Consus. ""Ops"" is also related to the Sanskrit word ""ápnas"" (""goods, property"").          According to Roman tradition, the cult of Opis was instituted by Titus Tatius, one of the Sabine kings of Rome. Opis soon became the patroness of riches, abundance, and prosperity. Opis had a famous temple in the Capitolium. Originally, a festival took place in Opis' honor on August 10. Additionally, on December 19 (some say December 9), the Opalia was celebrated. On August 25, the Opiconsivia was held. Opiconsivia was another name used for Opis, indicating when the earth was sown. These festivals also included activities that were called Consualia, in honor of Consus, her consort.          Opis, when syncretized with Greek mythology, was not only the wife of Saturn, she was his sister and the daughter of Caelus. Her children were Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres, and Vesta. Opis also acquired queenly status and was reputed to be an eminent goddess. By public decree temples, priests, and sacrifices were accorded her.","['Earth goddesses', 'Fertility goddesses', 'Roman goddesses', 'Rhea']"

He entered the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) on July 17, 1848, and graduated 15th in a class of 29 cadets on July 4, 1851. Throughout his final year he served as ""a cadet captain and company commander"". While attending VMI, Vaughan was a classmate of William Y.C. Humes, who stood 2nd in the class and would also serve as a Confederate general in the Civil War.          Vaughan took up civil engineering as his chosen profession, and initially moved to Saint Joseph, Missouri, working as a surveyor for the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad. Soon afterward he relocated to Southern California, where he served as deputy U.S. surveyor. He then briefly was on the staff of an official for the Northern Pacific Railroad. In this work Vaughan served as the private secretary of Alfred Cumming (uncle of Confederate general Alfred Cumming) who represented the railway in peace treaty talks with the Indians living on the upper portion of the Missouri River.           Finally settling in Marshall County, Mississippi, Vaughan took up work as a farmer. There he met Martha Jane Hardaway (1838–1911) and they were married on November 6, 1856, having eight children together. He was still working as a planter in Marshall County when the war began in 1861.          When the Civil War began in 1861, Vaughan chose to follow his home and adopted states and the Confederate cause, despite his strong Unionist feelings. He raised a company of fellow Mississippians for service, however the state was unable to arm and equip them, so Vaughan led them north to Moscow, Tennessee. There his men (dubbed the ""Dixie Rifles"") were added to the 13th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, and Vaughan entered the Confederate Army as its captain that May. That June the regiment was reorganized, and on June 7 he was elected its lieutenant colonel.           Vaughan and his regiment first saw action during the Battle of Belmont on November 7, 1861. On December 4 he was promoted to colonel and was given command of the 13th Tennessee. He then fought during the Battle of Shiloh on April 6–7, 1862, and was lightly wounded on the first day of the battle. Vaughan's conduct in this fight has been described as: "" ...he led his troops in a charge against the Union right, routing an Ohio regiment and causing a nearby battery to abandon 3 of its guns."" Beginning that fall he was given brigade command in the Army of Tennessee and both its previous namings (Army of Kentucky and of Mississippi).          Recovering from the injury, Vaughan participated in the Battle of Richmond on August 29–30, and the Battle of Perryville on October 8. He also fought during the Battle of Stones River (also called the Battle of Murfreesboro) from December 31 to January 2, 1863. Vaughan's most notable service was during the Battle of Chickamauga on September 17–18, 1863, after which he was given a field promotion personally by Confederate President Jefferson Davis ""for conspicuous gallentry."" Vaughan was promoted to brigadier general effective November 18, 1863, ""in recognition for his service to the Confederacy at Chickamauga."" An account of his performance in that fight follows:          During the Chattanooga Campaign that followed, Vaughan fought at the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863. He then participated in the Atlanta Campaign of 1864, and on July 4 Vaughan led his brigade during a skirmish at Vining's Station just after the Battle of Marietta on the previous day. Up to this point he had escaped serious injury, despite having at least eight horses shot from under him in combat. However, in this fight he was severely wounded when his leg was cut off by an exploding artillery shell, ending his active military service with the Confederate States. On May 10, 1865, Vaughan was paroled from Gainesville, Alabama, and returned home.          After the American Civil War ended in 1865, Vaughan returned to farming in Mississippi. In 1872 he moved to Tennessee, where into 1873 he participated in the Grange Movement at Memphis. He served as a general agent of the movement, responsible for the organization of state granges in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Vaughan also opened a mercantile business while in Memphis.          In 1878 Vaughan was elected clerk of the criminal court of Shelby County, Tennessee, and was re-elected in 1882. From 1897 until his death Vaughan has the head of the United Confederate Veterans chapter in Tennessee. Also in 1897 he published his book ""Personal Record of the Thirteenth Regiment, Tennessee Infantry"". He died two years later in Indianapolis, Indiana, and his body was returned to Memphis for burial in the city's Elmwood Cemetery.","['Confederate States Army brigadier generals', 'People of Virginia in the American Civil War', 'People from Dinwiddie County, Virginia', '1830 births', '1899 deaths', 'Virginia Military Institute alumni', 'American planters']"

The first was the E class of nine Double Fairlie steam locomotives of 1872-75; the second E class consisted of a Mallet compound made in 1906; and as both were no longer operated by the New Zealand Railways Department in 1923, the classification was free to be used for a third time when the small battery electric locomotive was delivered. This is the only time a classification has been used three times in New Zealand, though re-use happened a number of other times, arguably most notably when the A class of 1906 took the designation originally used by the A class of 1873.          This particular E class was ordered for service on the newly electrified Otira Tunnel section of the Midland line and was constructed in 1922. In April 1923, English Electric delivered an order of six locomotives: five EO class mainline locomotives that collected electricity from overhead wires, and a sixth small battery electric locomotive for maintenance duties. It was classified as E 1, had a wheel arrangement of Bo-Bo-2 under the UIC classification system, and worked for the rest of the 1920s.          Clearly not an exceptional performer, it was written off around 1930 due to the costs involved in maintaining its batteries. Instructions were issued for any equipment that could not be re-used elsewhere from the locomotive to be dumped locally. E 1's cab can still be found alongside the track just south of Otira. The runner wagon for E 1 was stripped of its batteries and found use at Addington Workshops as a general purpose wagon around the complex.

He joined professional sumo in 2000. His highest rank was ""maegashira"" 14, achieved in 2006. After illness saw him demoted to the third ""makushita"" division in 2008, he returned to the second highest ""jūryō"" division in 2010 and the top ""makuuchi"" division in September 2011. After winning the Sandanme division he had just been demoted to in November 2013, he chose to retire. He is now a coach at Sakaigawa stable.           He was born in the city of Hirosaki (as was Wakanosato). Hōchiyama was a member of Kizukuri High School sumo club (also attended by Mainoumi) and he made his professional debut in March 2000. He joined the Nakadachi stable set up by former ""komusubi"" Ryogoku, which was subsequently renamed Sakaigawa stable.          Hōchiyama took the ""jonokuchi"" championship with a perfect 7-0 record in his first tournament as a ""rikishi"" and he earned promotion to ""sandanme"" in November 2000 with another 7-0 score. However he found his opponents in the third ""makushita"" division much more difficult to deal with and his progress slowed. He narrowly missed out on promotion to the second highest ""jūryō"" division a number of times, recording 3-4 marks at ""makushita"" 1 in July 2004 and November 2005. After 24 tournaments in the third division he finally achieved promotion in January 2006 when a 4-3 score at ""makushita"" 4 was enough to reach ""jūryō"". He became the second member of his stable to reach ""sekitori"" status, following Iwakiyama, and the first to do it progressing through all the professional sumo divisions, Iwakiyama having made his debut in ""makushita"".          Hōchiyama reached the top ""makuuchi"" division in only in three tournaments, after winning the ""jūryō"" championship in July 2006 with a 13-2 record. He could only manage five wins in his top division debut in September 2006 and was demoted back to ""jūryō"". He reappeared in ""makuuchi"" in May 2007 but after two more ""make-koshi"" or losing scores he fell back to the second division once again in September of that year. He just missed out on immediate promotion back to the top division after recording seven wins against eight losses at the rank of ""jūryō"" 1. However, restricted by diabetes, a disastrous performance of 2-13 at the rank of ""jūryō"" 6 in the March 2008 tournament (which was his sixth consecutive losing score) saw him demoted to the third division for May.          After more than two years in ""makushita"", he finally returned to the ""sekitori"" ranks in July 2010 after scoring 5-2 at the rank of ""makushita"" 1 West in May. He came through with a winning record of 8-7, securing his ""kachi-koshi"" on the final day after four straight losses. He was one of seven ""rikishi"" from Sakaigawa stable ranked in ""jūryō"" in September 2010, the others being Iwakiyama, Goeido, Toyohibiki, Sadanoumi, Sadanofuji and Shironoryu. After a solid 9-6 at Juryo 5 in July 2011, he was promoted back to the top division for September after a 23 tournament absence - the fourth longest ever. He scored only 5-10 on his return and was immediately demoted back to ""juryo"", but he ensured with an 8-7 score at ""Juryo"" 1 in January 2012 that he was promoted to ""makuuchi"" once again for the March 2012 tournament. However he failed in his fifth attempt at a top division ""kachi-koshi"", finishing on 4–11.          In November 2013, after dropping to the ""sandanme"" division for the first time since the beginning of his career, Hōchiyama managed to take the championship. He still chose to retire before the beginning of the following January 2014 tournament. He has remained in sumo as a coach under the ""toshiyori"" or elder name of Kimgahama Oyakata. He had 29 tournaments at a ""sekitori"" rank; normally 30 are required to become an ""oyakata"" but Hochiyama was allowed because his stablemaster and previous owner of the stock acted as guarantors, under new Sumo Association rules brought in on November 17, 2013.           Hōchiyama's favourite techniques were listed by the Sumo Association as ""migi-yotsu"" (a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's ""mawashi""), ""yori"" (grappling) and ""tsuki"" (thrusting).

38614423,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38614423,Terminalia,"Terminalia was an ancient Roman festival in honour of the god Terminus, who presided over boundaries. His statue was merely a stone or post stuck in the ground to distinguish between properties. His worship is said to have been instituted by Numa who ordered that every one should mark the boundaries of his landed property by stones to be consecrated to Jupiter Terminalis, and at which every year sacrifices were to be offered at the festival of the Terminalia. On the festival the two owners of adjacent property crowned the statue with garlands and raised a crude altar, on which they offered up some corn, honeycombs, and wine, and sacrificed a lamb or a suckling pig. They concluded with singing the praises of the god. The public festival in honour of this god was celebrated at the sixth milestone on the road towards Laurentum doubtless because this was originally the extent of the Roman territory in that direction.          The festival of the Terminalia was celebrated VII. ""Kal. Mart."", or the 23d of February on the day before the Regifugium. The Terminalia was celebrated on the last day of the old Roman year, whence some derive its name. We know that February was the last month of the Roman year, and that when the intercalary month Mercedonius was added, the last five days of February were added to the intercalary month, making the 23d of February the last day of the year. When Cicero in a letter to Atticus says, ""Accepi tuas litteras a. d. V. Terminalia"" (i.e. Feb. 19), he uses this strange mode of defining a date, because being then in Cilicia he did not know whether any intercalation had been inserted that year.          The central Terminus of Rome (to which all roads led) was the god's ancient shrine on the Capitoline Hill. The temple of Jupiter, king of the gods, had to be built around it (with a hole in the ceiling as Terminus demanded open-air sacrifices) by the city's last king, Tarquinius Superbus, who had closed down other shrines on the site to make room for this prestigious project. But the augurs had read into the flight patterns of birds that the god Terminus refused to be moved, which was taken as a sign of stability for the city.","['Ancient Roman festivals', 'February observances']"

1169169,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1169169,Bicinium,"In music of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras, a bicinium (pl. bicinia) was a composition for only two parts, especially one for the purpose of teaching counterpoint or singing.          The term has had two usages in music history:          The term was first used in Poland, by Jan z Lublina in a treatise of 1540. Volumes of bicinia were published in the next several decades in Germany, the Low Countries, and even in Italy, as the usefulness of bicinia as teaching aids became apparent. In addition, Martin Luther had strongly expressed that children should learn both music, and the psalms: bicinia with German texts from the Psalms fulfilled his purpose.          Students could be expected to master singing a single part in a duet more easily than a part in a larger ensemble. Usually a bicinium was designed to be sung or played by students of the same age and ability, rather than for a single student and a teacher.          This model of moving from two-part study, writing, and singing to three parts and then more was adopted by Heinrich Glarean in his ""Dodecachordon"" (1547), one of the most influential music theory and pedagogy treatises of the Renaissance.          In a similar manner, present-day music students typically learn counterpoint first by writing in two parts, and then later in three, only moving to four or more parts after mastering the earlier stages.          A similar pedagogical composition for three voices is known as a tricinium (pl. tricinia).","['Renaissance music', 'Baroque music', 'European music', 'Music education']"
6494456,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6494456,Lillian Smith (author),"Lillian Eugenia Smith (December 12, 1897 – September 28, 1966) was a writer and social critic of the Southern United States, known most prominently for her best-selling novel ""Strange Fruit"" (1944). A white woman who openly embraced controversial positions on matters of race and gender equality, she was a southern liberal unafraid to criticize segregation and work toward the dismantling of Jim Crow laws, at a time when such actions virtually guaranteed social ostracism.          Smith was born on December 12, 1897, to a prominent family in Jasper, Florida, the seventh of nine children. Her life as the daughter of a middle-class civic and business leader took an abrupt turn in 1915 when her father lost his turpentine mills. The family was not without resources, however, and decided to relocate to their summer residence in the mountains of Clayton, Georgia, where her father had previously purchased property and operated the Laurel Falls Camp for Girls.          Now a young adult financially on her own, she was free to pursue her love of music and teaching for the next five years. She spent a year studying at Piedmont College in Demorest, Georgia (1915–1916). She also had two stints at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in 1917 and 1919. She returned home and helped her parents manage a hotel and taught in two mountain schools before accepting a position to be director of music at a Methodist school for girls in Huzhou, (now Wuxing, Zhejiang), China. She was not a churchgoer and did not consider herself religious.          Her time in China was limited, however, by problems back home. Her father's health was declining and she was forced to return home to the States in 1925. Back in Georgia, she assumed the role of heading the Laurel Falls Camp, a position she would hold for the next twenty three years (1925–48). Laurel Falls Camp soon became very popular as an innovative educational institution known for its instruction in the arts, music, drama, and modern psychology. Her father died in 1930, and she was left with responsibility for the family business and the care of her ill mother. It was this period of creative control over the camp, her ability to use it as a place to discuss modern social issues, combined with the pressures of caring for her ailing parents that made her turn to writing as an emotional escape.          Lillian Smith soon formed a lifelong relationship with one of the camp's school counselors, Paula Snelling, of Pinehurst, Georgia. The two remained closeted as a same-sex couple for the rest of their lives, as their correspondence has shown. The couple began publishing a small, quarterly literary magazine, ""Pseudopodia"", in 1936. The magazine encouraged writers, black or white, to offer honest assessments of modern southern life, to challenge for social and economic reform, and it criticized those who ignored the Old South's poverty and injustices. It quickly gained regional fame as a forum for liberal thought, undergoing two name changes to reflect its expanding scope. In 1937 it became the ""North Georgia Review"", and in 1942 finally settling with ""South Today"".          In 1944 she published the bestselling novel ""Strange Fruit"", which dealt with the then-forbidden and controversial theme of interracial romance. The title was originally ""Jordan is so Chilly"", with Smith later changing the title to ""Strange Fruit"". In her autobiography, singer Billie Holiday wrote that Smith chose to name the book after her song ""Strange Fruit"", which was about the lynching and racism against African-Americans, although Smith maintained that the book's title referred to the ""damaged, twisted people (both black and white) who are the products or results of our racist culture."" After the book's release, the book was banned in Boston and Detroit for ""lewdness"" and crude language. ""Strange Fruit"" was also banned from being mailed through the U.S. Postal Service, with the ban against the book being lifted by President Roosevelt after his wife Eleanor Roosevelt requested it of him.          In 1949, Smith kept up her personal assault on racism with ""Killers of the Dream"", a collection of essays that attempted to identify, challenge and dismantle the Old South's racist traditions, customs and beliefs, warning that segregation corrupted the soul. She also emphasized the negative implications on the minds of women and children. Written in a confessional and autobiographical style that was highly critical of southern moderates, it met with something of a cruel silence from book critics and the literary community.          In 1955, the civil rights movement grabbed the entire nation's attention with the Montgomery bus boycott. By this time she had been meeting or corresponding with many southern blacks and liberal whites for years and was well aware of blacks' concerns. In response to Brown v. Board of Education, the ruling that outlawed segregation in schools, she wrote ""Now Is the Time"" (1955), calling for compliance with the new court decision. She called the new ruling ""every child's Magna Carta"".          Smith battled breast cancer from the early 1950s on and died on September 28, 1966, at the age of 68. Her book ""The Journey"" (1954) details some of this battle.          Today, ""Strange Fruit"" remains her most famous work, translated into fifteen languages, but many of her works, like ""Killers of the Dream"", are being rediscovered and given their due as groundbreaking in both style and substance. She no doubt deserves recognition as one of the first prominent Southern whites to write about and speak out openly against racism and segregation. Her lifelong convictions are summed up in her acceptance speech for the Charles S. Johnson Award at Fisk University in 1966: ""Segregation is evil; there is no pattern of life which can dehumanize men as can the way of segregation.""          Since 1968, the Lillian Smith Book Awards have been presented annually, except for 2003 when the Southern Regional Council experienced funding shortfalls.

Duke Albrecht was born in Vienna as the eldest child of Duke Philipp of Württemberg and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, daughter of Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen.          At the start of World War I, Duke Albrecht commanded the German 4th Army and led them to victory in the Battle of the Ardennes in August 1914. Following this victory, the 4th Army saw action in the First Battle of the Marne before being transferred to Flanders in October, where Duke Albrecht commanded them during the Battle of the Yser. Duke Albrecht also commanded the German forces during the Second Battle of Ypres, where poison gas was used on a large scale for the first time.          Duke Albrecht was awarded the Pour le Mérite in August 1915 and was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall in August 1916. The newly formed Army Group Albrecht was placed under his command in February 1917 and he was responsible for the southern sector of the Western Front until the Armistice.          Duke Albrecht had become heir presumptive to the Kingdom of Württemberg following the death of his father in October 1917, but, following the German Empire's World War I defeat and the abdication of his cousin King Willhelm II of Württemberg following the German Revolution, he never succeeded to the throne. He became head of the House of Württemberg on the death of Wilhelm on October 2, 1921.          Duke Albrecht died at Altshausen Castle on October 29, 1939. His son Duke Philipp Albrecht succeeded him as head of the House of Württemberg.           Duke Albrecht was married in Vienna on 24 January 1893 to Archduchess Margarete Sophie of Austria, a daughter of Archduke Carl Ludwig.

1885219,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1885219,4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht),"The 4th Panzer Division () was an armoured division in the German Army, the Wehrmacht, during World War II, established in 1938.          It participated in the 1939 invasion of Poland, the 1940 invasion of France, and the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. It remained on the Eastern Front, mainly under Army Group Centre, until it was trapped on the coast at Courland in the summer of 1944. It was evacuated by sea and returned to the main front in West Prussia in January 1945. It surrendered to the Soviets there at the end of the war.           During the Polish campaign, the division engaged in a series of massacres against the civilian population and POW's.          The 4th Panzer Division was formed in Würzburg, Bavaria, on 10 November 1938 as the first of a second wave of new armoured divisions in Germany following the creation of the original three tank divisions in 1935. Alongside the 4th Panzer Division the 5th was formed at Oppeln, now Opole in Poland, five days later.          Würzburg had previously been the garrison town for the 2nd Panzer Division which had moved its head quarters to Vienna after the ""Anschluss"" of Austria in March 1938.          At the beginning of the Invasion of Poland (1939), the division was one of the first to cross the border in the operational area of Army Group South. Equipped with roughly 341 tanks, including 183 Panzer I, 130 Panzer II, 12 Panzer IV and 16 PzBef. The division lacked some infantry and anti-tank units. Polish historian Mieczysław Bielski wrote that immediately after entering Polish territory, on 1 September, the division used civilians as human shields during the battle of Mokra. During that battle the division was fighting the Polish Volhynian Cavalry Brigade under Colonel Julian Filipowicz. According to the Polish historians Kazimierz Leszczyński and Janusz Gumkowski, a Polish aircraft was shot down on 3 September and its crew taken prisoner. One of its passengers was brutally interrogated, tortured (German soldiers cut off his nose, ears and tongue) and then executed by personnel of the 4th Division.          After supporting 1st Panzer, the division took part in the break-through of the Polish lines near Kłobuck, the Poles withdrew. Three days later, the 4th Panzer Division continued its move towards Warsaw. It reached the Polish capital on 8 September and tried to take the city by surprise. At 17.00, the forces of the 4th Panzer Division supported by the 31st Infantry Division attempted an assault on Warsaw's western borough of Ochota. The assault was repulsed and the German forces suffered heavy casualties. The following day, the division was reinforced with artillery and the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler motorised infantry regiment, and began another assault towards Ochota and Wola. Well-placed Polish anti-tank guns and barricades erected on main streets repulsed this assault. On several occasions, the lack of armament on the Polish side was made up for by ingenuity. One of the streets leading towards the city centre was covered with turpentine from a nearby factory. When German tanks approached, the liquid was set on fire, and the tanks were destroyed without a shot being fired. The German forces suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat. After the failed assault on Warsaw, 4th Panzer Division was withdrawn westward and took part in the Battle of the Bzura, where it supported a German counter-attack.          Polish-Jewish historian, Szymon Datner, stated that on 18 September, in the village of Śladów, units of the 4th Panzer Division shot or drowned 252 prisoners of war and 106 civilians in the Vistula.          After that it was withdrawn to the Niederrhein.          During the Battle of France in 1940, the division came under the command of Erich Hoepner's XVI Panzer Corps, part of von Kleist's Panzer Group in the 6th Army commanded by Walther von Reichenau. After a blitzkrieg assault through Liege and Charleroi, it reached the area of Bethune, where it fought against the British Expeditionary Force in what became known as the battle of Dunkirk. However, due to Adolf Hitler's orders, it did not manage to capture Dunkirk itself. In early June 1940, the division managed to cross a large part of France in several days. By the time that the cease fire was signed, it had reached Grenoble almost unopposed. After several months of occupation duty in France, in late November, the 4th Division was withdrawn to Würzburg, where it was reorganized and reinforced. The 36th Panzer Regiment was detached and assigned to the newly formed 14th Panzer Division, while the 103rd Artillery Regiment was reinforced with a third battalion.          The division was moved to East Prussia and then to the area of Brześć Litewski in occupied Poland, where it was assigned to the XXIV Panzer Corps under Geyr von Schweppenburg. On 22 June 1941, it took part in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During the first day, the division managed to drive a wedge into the Soviet positions and reached Kobryń some 65 kilometres behind the lines. The division then spearheaded one of the pincer moves to surround and destroy a large Soviet force in the battle of Minsk, where the German army took approximately 300,000 prisoners. After the battle of Homel it reached Kiev, where it fought against another pocket of resistance.          In September 1941, the division was attached to Army Group Centre, which was preparing to take part in the battle of Moscow. The assault started on 30 September 1941, the division captured Orel in early October but was ambushed on the road to Mtsensk by 1st Guards Rifle Corps on the 6th of that month. Attempts by the outclassed Panzers to maneuver round the Soviet flanks were defeated with heavy loss as the soviet T-34s savaged the underarmored Mark IV tanks, reducing much of the divisional armor to burned out, smoking wreckage by end of day. The advance resumed with growing loss and in late October Heinz Guderian concentrated most of the 2nd Panzer groups' remaining tanks into a single brigade under the 4th Panzer division, the spearhead of the XXIV Panzer Corps. By mid-November it was down to 50 tanks but still ground on reaching Tula, as the southern arm of a pincer which tried to surround the Soviet capital. The Germans formations were paralysed when the autumn rains set in, turning the only road to Tula into a stretch of mud. Bogged down German tanks were attacked by Soviet aircraft. With the onset of frost in early November, the Germans could use the roads again, but faced the problem of not being equipped for winter warfare. Warm clothing and white camouflage suits were lacking, and tanks and other vehicles were immobilised as temperatures dropped below freezing.          On 5 December, the division was withdrawn and ordered to defend a stretch of front near Moscow against a . In a series of retreats, the division lost almost all of its tanks. A month later it had only 25 machines still operational. It withdrew to the Orel area, where the thaw halted the Soviet counter-offensive and the unit could be partially reinforced. Throughout 1942 it fought in the battle of Orel, a series of almost World War I-like skirmishes, assaults and counter-assaults. It took part in the failed battle of Kursk, after which it withdrew to the area along the Desna River. After a series of Soviet advances, the front line was finally stabilized near Bobruysk, where the division spent the winter of 1943–1944.          In the spring of 1944, the division moved to the area of Kowel in occupied Poland, where it was to support Army Group South during the expected Soviet spring offensive. However, Operation Bagration, (started on 22 June 1944), was aimed at Army Group Centre and the division retreated with the rest of the German army. Assigned to the XXXIX Panzer Corps under Gen. Karl Decker, the division withdrew to the area of Warsaw, where the Soviet advance ran out of momentum at the end of July. The 4th Panzer Division took part in the Battle of Radzymin (also known as the Battle of Wołomin) and on 2 August 1944, alongside the 19th Panzer Division, threw the Soviet III Tank Corps back to Wolomin. The Soviet Tank Corps suffered heavy losses and their advance halted.          The division was then transported to northern Lithuania, where it was to support Army Group North. It was attached to the 3rd Panzer Army. The Soviet advance cut the German army group in two and the division was mostly dispersed. Some of its sub-units were cut off from the rest of German-held territory, along with the 16th and 18th Armies, in Livonia on the Courland Peninsula, where they supported the defense until the end of the war. Other units were attached to smaller, often improvised formations. They were destroyed by the Soviet offensive of April–May 1945.

4716261,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4716261,Pagoclone,"Pagoclone is an anxiolytic drug from the cyclopyrrolone family, related to better-known drugs such as the sleeping medication zopiclone. It was synthesized by a French team working for Rhone-Poulenc & Rorer S.A. It is one of a relatively recently developed class of medicines known as the nonbenzodiazepines, which have similar effects to the older benzodiazepine group, but with quite different chemical structures.          Pagoclone was originally developed as an anti-anxiety drug, but never commercialised. It is a partial agonist acting at GABA receptors in the brain. In contrast to zopiclone, pagoclone produces anxiolytic effects with little or no sedative or amnestic actions at low doses. This is because pagoclone is a subtype-selective drug which binds primarily to the α/α subtypes of the GABA receptor which are responsible for the anti-anxiety effects of drugs of this kind, but has relatively little efficacy at the α subtype which produces the sedative and memory loss effects.          Prof. David Nutt has suggested pagoclone as a possible base from which to make a better social drug, as it produces the positive effects of alcohol, such as relaxation and sociability, but without also causing the negative effects like aggression, amnesia, nausea, loss of coordination and liver damage. Its effect can be quickly reversed by the action of flumazenil, which is already used as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose.          Nutt has published studies praising the potential of pagoclone which were financed by Indevus which holds the patents to the pharmaceutical and is, as of Spring 2006, seeking funding for a possible production of the compound. The significance of this is undetermined, but the long-term safety of pagoclone has not been assessed. The abuse potential of pagoclone has been assessed as being similar to, or slightly less than that of diazepam and it would also be expected to be somewhat safer due to its relatively weaker sedative effects, but development of pagoclone as a commercial drug would still be unlikely due to concerns about abuse.          Pagoclone is also being trialed as a drug to improve a stammerer's speech fluency.          Pagoclone and pazinaclone are both isoindolone          Reaction of 2-Amino-7-chloro-1,8-naphthyridine with phthalic anhydride leads to the corresponding phthalimide. Selective reduction of one of the imide carbonyl groups give the corresponding alcohol. Reaction with the carbanion from Ethyl 5-methyl-3-oxohexanoate leads to the product from the displacement of the hydroxyl group; 'this too may proceed via the acrylate obtained from aldol reaction of the ring opened imidal'.","['Anxiolytics', 'Chloroarenes', 'Cyclopyrrolones', 'GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators', 'Isoindolines', 'Ketones', 'Lactams', 'Naphthyridines']"

Born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Mills received his earliest instruction from his father, who was organist at Gloucester Cathedral. The father was a great admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach, hence the name he gave his firstborn son. In adulthood, Mills simply signed himself ""S.B. Mills."" In spite of the name and his father's vocation, Mills chose piano over the organ. His precocious talent brought him to the attention of the French light music composer Louis-Antoine Jullien, who engaged the ""infant prodigy"" for his earliest concert performances.          Young Mills played at Drury Lane Theatre in London in 1846 at the age of six, performing Czerny’s ""Rondo Brillant on Themes from Preciosa"" and gave a command performance before Queen Victoria at age seven. He studied in England with Cipriani Potter and William Sterndale Bennett and at the Leipzig Conservatory with Louis Plaidy, Carl Czerny, Ignaz Moscheles, Julius Rietz and Moritz Hauptmann. At Leipzig, he met his future wife, Antonia Young, a native of Germany whose family had emigrated to Chicago.          He went to America in 1856 and, after some disappointing initial receptions, was engaged by New York Philharmonic Society music director Carl Bergmann to perform the Schumann ""Piano Concerto in A minor"". Its favorable reception before a largely German-speaking crowd let Bergmann to re-engage Mills for other performances, and the pianist appeared annually with the Philharmonic Society from 1859 to 1877. He also made tours of Germany in 1859, 1867 and 1878. A personal friend of William Steinway, he performed exclusively on Steinway pianos.          Mills retired from active concertizing in 1880 - coincident with the arrival in New York of pianist Rafael Joseffy, who was more often engaged by the New York Philharmonic's new music director, Theodore Thomas to play Mills' repertoire – and he subsequently devoted himself to teaching. Suffering from failing health in his latter years, he moved to Germany at his wife's insistence in April 1898 and died in Wiesbaden on December 21.

Growing up in Frankish Schweinfurt – his father was a Lutheran minister – it was already clear to him as a child that he wanted to go into a religious profession. From 1890 Rittelmeyer studied philosophy and Protestant theology in Erlangen and Berlin evangelische. Among his teachers were Adolf von Harnack and Julius Kaftan, and later Oswald Külpe, who encouraged him to write his dissertation on Friedrich Nietzsche.          He also went on a study trip to meet theologians and socially-engaged ministers of the time, as well as members of the Moravian Church. From 1895 to 1902 he was at the Stadtvikar in Würzburg, from which in 1903 he took up the preachership of Heilig-Geist-Kirche in Nuremberg. There he married Julie Kerler on 5 April 1904. Rittelmeyer worked and closely collaborated with Christian Geyer (1862–1929), the head preacher of the Sebalduskirche, and the pair produced two joint volumes of sermons. Around 1910 they both led discussions with the Bavarian church council on a liberal interpretation of the Bible and the denomination.          In 1916 Rittelmeyer was sent to the Neue Kirche in Berlin, working as preacher there. At first gripped by nationalist enthusiasm, he soon came to oppose the First World War and with 4 other Berlin theologians signed a proclamation of peace and understanding on the occasion of Reformation Day (October 1917).          The Nuremberg school teacher Michael Bauer in 1910 enabled Rittelmeyer to have his first encounter with Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Rittelmeyer described the encounter and discussed Steiner's personality and work in his ""Meine Lebensbegegnung mit Rudolf Steiner"" (""Rudolf Steiner Enters my Life""). In the ""Christengemeinschaft"" he established in September 1922, Rittelmeyer acted as its first Kultushandlungen (Priesterweihe der Begründenden und Altarsakrament). He was the first ""Erzoberlenker"" of the ""Movement for Religious Revival"" (another term for the Christengemeinschaft) and from its base in Stuttgart was its leading envoy right up to his death. Under National Socialism, he carried out a permanent balancing act: between critical intellectual discussion with Nazism in numerous publications on the one hand and his task of enabling a survival strategy for the Christengemeinschaft (for which he felt responsible) on the other.","['1872 births', '1938 deaths', 'People from Dillingen an der Donau', 'People from the Kingdom of Bavaria', 'German Protestant clergy', 'Anthroposophists']"

3141359,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3141359,Abdul Nacer Benbrika,"Abdul Nacer Benbrika () (born in Algeria about 1960), also known as Abu Bakr (Arabic: أبو بكر), was one of 17 men arrested in the Australian cities of Sydney and Melbourne in November 2005, charged with being members of a terrorist organisation and of planning terrorist attacks on targets within the country. Benbrika is alleged to be the spiritual leader of the group. All 17 men pleaded not guilty. On 15 September 2008 Benbrika was found guilty on the charge of intentionally being the leader and a member of a terrorist organisation.          Benbrika was born in Algeria: various sources give his age as 45 or 46 as of November 2005. He was trained as an aircraft engineer. He arrived in Australia in May 1989 on a one-month visitor's permit, on which he twice gained extensions, and settled in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, an area with a large Muslim population. After his permit expired in 1990 he became a prohibited non-citizen, then spent the next six years fighting through the Immigration Review Tribunal appeals process, for the right to stay. During his hearings he told the tribunal of his ""love of the Australian lifestyle"".          In 1992 Benbrika married a Lebanese woman who was an Australian citizen, with whom he had seven children. He was granted Australian residence in 1996 and became a citizen in 1998, although he is reported to have retained his Algerian citizenship as well. He has been on government welfare benefits for so many years and this has become a topic of debate.          His teachings became increasingly politicised after the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. This came at a time when the Muslim community was under intense scrutiny from the Australian government and media outlets.          Benbrika was said to have been a teacher and a deputy-leader at the Islamic Information & Support Centre of Australia led by Mohammed Omran who, as Sheikh Abu Ayman, also lead the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (Australia). Omran has denied that he had close ties with Benbrika.          Benbrika began teaching smaller groups on a less formal basis after he refused the requests of more formal organisations that he tone down his teachings.          Islamic Council of Victoria board member Waleed Aly said Benbrika's group was ""a splinter of a splinter of a splinter. Most Muslims had never heard of him until he appeared on the ABC's [""7.30 Report]""."" Waleed Aly was quoted as saying. ""... He formed his own group with a handful of young men who he calls his students."" Benbrika's students included a number of those arrested along with him in November, one of whom is alleged to have undergone military training in Afghanistan.          Benbrika came to public attention when he told an Australian ABC interviewer: ""Osama bin Laden, he is a great man. Osama bin Laden was a great man before 11 September, which they said he did it, until now nobody knows who did it."" He was quoted as defending Muslims fighting against coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and said anyone who fought in the name of God would be forgiven their sins. ""According to my religion, jihad is a part of my religion and what you have to understand is that anyone who fights for the sake of Allah, when he dies, the first drop of blood that comes from him out all his sin will be forgiven.""          During 2004 and 2005 Australian security agencies had Benbrika under surveillance as a possible instigator of terrorist acts. In March his passport was withdrawn on advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), and ASIO agents raided his Melbourne home in June. In November, according to media reports, ASIO became convinced that Benbrika's group, and affiliated group in Sydney, was actively planning a terrorist attack. It was at this time that the federal government was introducing new anti-terrorism legislation, the Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005. It is said that on the advice of ASIO, the Australian Parliament amended the law relating to terrorism, broadening the definition of planning 'a' terrorist act. A few days later police raids in Sydney and Melbourne arrested Benbrika and 16 other men, one of whom was shot after allegedly opening fire on police in Sydney. It has also been said that the timing of the arrests was planned to coincide with the new laws.          Benbrika and his 12 fellow defendants (including Shane Kent, Fadal Sayadi, Ahmed Raad, Amer Haddara, Abdulla Merhi Ezzit Raad, Hany Taha and Aimen Joud) appeared in a Melbourne magistrate's court the day after their arrest. All are of Muslim immigrant backgrounds except Kent, who is a convert. Benbrika was charged with ""directing the activities of a terrorist organization."" He did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody. Several of his fellow defendants applied for bail on numerous occasions during their pre-trial remand detention in the maximum security Acacia Unit of Barwon Prison, from November 2005 until their trial began in February 2008.          Benbrika also had links to the defendants in the 2005 Sydney terrorism plot, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Mohamed Ali Elomar, Abdul Rakib Hasan, and Mohammed Omar Jamal.          Government and police officials said the group was stockpiling chemicals that could have been used to make explosives, Butthey had not been charged with this offense. According to the Melbourne ""Herald Sun"", the group was ""plotting a terrorist spectacular on the scale of the al-Qaeda attacks on London and Madrid."" The explosive device they were assembling was called the ""Mother of Satan"" by the jihadists. Victorian police commissioner Christine Nixon said she believed the arrests, which came after 16 months of police surveillance, had ""seriously disrupted the activities of a group intent on carrying out a terrorist attack"". The raids were planned after new information was obtained, she said. She said although the group had no known specific target, ""We were concerned that the attack was imminent, and we believe that we have sufficient evidence that will go before the courts to show that.""          In an interview before his arrest, Benbrika denied he was involved in terrorist activities. ""I am not involved in anything here,"" he said. ""I am teaching my brothers here the Koran and the Sunnah, and I am trying my best to keep myself, my family, my kids and the Muslims close to their religion.""          In company with the other defendants, Benbrika appeared in a Melbourne court in March 2007, under extremely strict security. The proceedings of the case are subject to severe reporting restrictions in Victoria.          The trial of Benbrika began in October 2007. He and 11 other accused were charged of terrorism offences. The case was presided over by Justice Bernard Bongiorno and was initially prosecuted by Nick Robinson, but later trials included Richard Maidment SC as prosecutor. Benbrika was represented by Remy Van de Weil QC with Josh Taaffe of Doogue & O'Brien (now Doogue O'Brien George) instructing him.          At a hearing in February 2008, the prosecution in its opening remarks outlined the details of 500 phone conversations, recorded by telephone intercepts and hidden listening devices, between Benbrika and the 11 men in his group also on trial. Prosecutors alleged phone records revealed the group's plans: ""to cause maximum damage. To cause the death of a thousand ... by use of a bomb.""          They allege the group led by Benbrika was ""bent on violent jihad"" and ""planned terrorist attacks on football games or train stations to maximise deaths"" and that Benbrika said that in some cases it was theologically permissible to ""kill women, children and the elderly"".          The court was told how Benbrika allegedly used at least 10 different mobile phones that were registered under false names and addresses.          The jury in the case retired to consider its verdict on 20 August 2008. On 15 September Benbrika was found guilty on the charge of intentionally being the leader and a member of a terrorist organisation.          On 3 February 2009 Supreme Court Justice Bernard Bongiorno sentenced Benbrika to 15 years jail with a non-parole period of 12 years. In his comments Bongiorno said the word jihad had many meanings in Islam, but Benbrika had warped the term to mean ""only a violent attack by his group to advance the Islamic cause"". Bongiorno also said evidence ""suggested that Benbrika was still committed to violent jihad, had shown no contrition for his offences and had talked about continuing the group's activities behind bars if its members were jailed"".          Apart from the charges of Intentionally being a member of a terrorist organisation and Intentionally directing activities of a terrorist organisation, Benbrika was also convicted in a later trial of Possession of a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act. But a further ruling in March 2011 has found him not guilty of this later charge. This conviction for the offence of Possession of a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act was quashed, with the court concluding ""that the trial judge had misdirected the jury as to the requirements for establishing that offence."" His sentence for the charge of Intentionally being a member of a terrorist organisation was also reduced from 7 to 5 years.          While in jail, Benbrika has been able to exert significant influence in spreading jihadist ideology. Associates and relatives of his have died fighting for Islamic State.","['Algerian emigrants to Australia', 'Australian activists', 'Muslim activists', '1960s births', 'Living people', 'Algerian Islamists', 'Australian Islamists', 'Sunni Islamists', 'Australian prisoners and detainees', 'Algerian Sunni Muslims', 'Australian Sunni Muslims', 'People imprisoned on charges of terrorism', 'Islamist insurgents', 'War on Terror', 'Australian people of Algerian descent']"

2115308,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115308,Moishe Postone,"Moishe Postone (born 1942) is a Canadian Western Marxist historian, philosopher and political economist. He is Professor of History at the University of Chicago, where he is part of the Committee on Jewish Studies.          Moishe Postone, son of a Canadian Rabbi, received his Ph.D. from University of Frankfurt in 1983.          His research interests include modern European intellectual history; social theory, especially critical theories of modernity; twentieth-century Germany; anti-Semitism; and contemporary global transformations. He is co-editor with Craig Calhoun and Edward LiPuma of ""Bourdieu: Critical Perspectives"" and author of ""Time, Labor and Social Domination: A Reinterpretation of Marx's Critical Theory"". He is also co-editor with Eric Santner of ""Catastrophe and Meaning: The Holocaust and the Twentieth Century"", a collection of essays that consider the meaning of the holocaust in twentieth-century history and its influence on historical practice. Postone's work has had a large influence on the anti-Germans.          He was originally denied tenure by the University of Chicago's Sociology Department, sparking a great deal of public resentment from graduate students whom he had been involved in teaching. He was later granted tenure by the History Department.          Today Moishe Postone is the Thomas E. Donnelley Professor of Modern History and co-director of the Chicago Center for Contemporary Theory.          In 1978 Postone started a critical analysis on Marx's theory of value.          But Moishe Postone's most distinguished main work, 'Time, Labor and Social Domination', was published in 1993 (translated into French in 2009 and Japanese in 2012).          In his works he proposes a fundamental reinterpretation of Karl Marx's critique of political economy, focusing on Marx's original concepts value, capital and labour. Inspired by heterodox Marxist thinkers such as Isaak Rubin, Roman Rosdolsky, etc., and certain authors of the Frankfurt School, e.g., Sohn-Rethel, who remained marginal to that school, he shows that the assumptions of the 'pessimistic turn' of Horkheimer were historically rather than theoretically founded. Postone interprets critical writings on Marx's economics, especially in its Capital 1 edition, and Grundrisse, as the development of a social-mediational theory of value.          Postone thinks that in writing the 'Grundrisse' Marx concludes that adequate critical theory must be completely immanent to its purpose. The criticism cannot be taken from a point of view external to its object, but must appear in the mode of presentation itself. Das Kapital is so structured, for Postone, with a surface level immanent to political economics discourse and a deeper layer that grounds this discourse, which makes it particularly difficult to interpret. Indeed, precisely because of the inherent nature of the format Marx uses, the object of the critique of Marx has often been taken as the standpoint of this criticism. For example, not only is the categories of exchange value historically specific to the capitalist period, but also value's basis, the capitalist form of wage labour, must also be historically specific, and does not apply conceptually to other periods. The methodological sections of the Grundrisse clarify therefore not only Marx's presentation, but other sections make explicit that the categories of capital such as value and exchange-labour, are historically specific to the capitalist social formation. The so-called labour theory of value is not a theory of the material wealth created by labor but is in a parallel manner also seen when looked at transhistorically as ""human metabolism with nature."" Precisely because it is not structured immanently, the 'Grundrisse' provides a key to read Capital. This is the key to the reinterpretation of the work of mature Marx, with which Postone works.          Starting in this demonstration of the historically specific character of what Marx critiques, Postone then provides a new critical theory that attacks the very essence of capitalism: the form of labour specific to the capitalist social formation. Indeed, in non-capitalist societies, work is distributed by overt social relations. An individual acquires goods produced by others through the medium of undisguised social relations. Work activities derive their meaning and are determined by personal relationships, openly social and qualitatively specific (differentiated by social group, social status, the wide range of customs, traditional ties, etc.). But in a capitalist social formation, ""the objectification of labor is the means by which goods produced by others is acquired; we work to acquire other products So someone other than producer that uses the product (as well as use value) - the producer, it serves as a means for acquiring work products from other producers. It is in this sense that a product is a commodity. It is both use-value for each other and medium of exchange for the producer. This means that the work has a dual function; on one hand, it is a specific type of work that produces goods individuals to others, but on the other hand, the work, regardless of its specific content, is the producer of means to acquire the products of others. This feature of the work, which is specific to the social life in capitalism, is the basis of modern socialization, is called ""abstract labor."" In the functioning of these new social relationships, labour under capitalism is no longer an external activity to capitalism. It is the foundation of capitalism, and so is the labour that must be abolished.          It appears increasingly today that the new concept of ""commodity fetishism,"" which has nothing to do with a hoax of consciousness (an inverted representation), is the central part of the intellectual heritage Marx. ""Commodity fetishism"" is not only a misrepresentation, much less an exaggerated adoration of goods. The ""fetish"" instead is to be referred to the structure of the commodity. It is then a theory of ""objective fetishism"" (Jappe) or radicalized, that is to say, so long as value (the objectification of the specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism), the goods and money, society is actually governed by the self-movement of created things themselves, and not by the subjective manipulation of the ruling classes. The subjects are not men, but it is rather their objectified relationships that are at the heart of socialization under capitalism. Fetishism, Postone notes, must be analyzed ""in terms of the structure of social relations constituted by forms of praxis and its seizure by objectifying the category of capital (and hence value). The Subject for Marx, like Hegel is so abstract and can not be identified with any social actor whatsoever ""(Postone, Time, p. 75-76). This is the world where abstract labour (which is not immaterial labor) becomes the social bond, social mediation that mediates itself, reducing actual work to a simple expression abstract labor. Abstract labor is then the source of alienation. The self-moving subject, Spirit, Geist, is misrecognized in Hegel, it is described by Marx as Capital and its self-valorization. It is not, Postone suggests, similar to Lukacs' use of Hegel, wherein the proletariat are identified as Spirit, for then spirit would be labour not emancipation.          It is from this concept that we can build a radical critique of the commodity, money, value, labor and politics, that is to say, a critique that is not limited to describe the struggles around management and distribution, the ""class struggle"" as traditionally understood, but recognizing that these categories themselves are problematic: they are specific only to capitalist modernity, and are responsible for its destructive and self-destructive nature. Pointing out that the market is a mere mechanism of distribution, and so is secondary to the core of capitalism allows Postone to broaden the historical scope of Marx's theory and so it can, with equal validity, be applied to what was the USSR. In the USSR the main difference was that instead of a market handling distribution it was planners; however, the abstract exchange of labour, which is the core of capitalism for Postone, was as it was in the West.          In his 1986 article, Anti-Semitism and National Socialism, Moishe Postone developed new thinking on modern anti-Semitism, and particularly on National Socialist ideology. Postone sees it as a major element in the development of a socio-historical theory of consciousness determined by social forms that are subjected to socialization under capitalism. What is said about modern anti-Semitism may also describe a trend of vulgar anti-capitalism that seeks the personification of the elements of capitalism that are so hated.          Postone shows that modern anti-Semitism is very different from most forms of racism and Christian anti-Semitism. It differs from them because it casts a huge global invisible power of international Jewery, it is the idea of a global conspiracy that is intrinsic to modern anti-Semitism. Postone analyzes anti-Semitism against the Marxian notion of dual character of the commodity category. And he observes that the characteristics that distinguishes anti-Semitism among the Jews are the same as for the value: abstraction, invisibility, automation, impersonal domination. Postone argues that the form of socialization under capitalism (the historically specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism) makes it possible to separate the concrete (as socially ""natural"" sound, true, etc..).          This opposition between the concrete and the abstract determined by social forms, pervades all forms of subjectivity, and thus helps to understand a central feature of the National Socialist ideology. Because this ideology was not fundamentally anti-modern and it would be wrong to label it as such. It is true that claimed the defense of the peasantry and craftsmanship, but also said the modern technological and industrial production. Nazism was rather a vulgar form of anti-capitalism. The rejection of the bourgeoisie and its values is present in Nazism. There is more sense to see the Nazi ideology as the affirmation of the concrete dimension - which includes technology and industrial production, as well as the peasantry and manual labor - as heart healthy social life, organic, and it against the abstract dimension materialized by finance capital. The abstract is instead rejected - and it is personified by the Jews. Postone analyzes the figure of the Jew in the modern anti-Semitism as the embodiment of abstract value and extermination camps can be interpreted as a misbegotten notion of a ""factory"" to destroy value.","['1942 births', 'Living people', 'American historians', 'American people of Canadian-Jewish descent', 'Jewish American historians', 'University of Chicago faculty']"

He was the older brother of gang member Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters.          Switzer was born in Paris, Illinois, the first son of Gladys C. Shanks and George Frederick Switzer. He and younger brother Carl became famous around their hometown for their musical talent and performances; both sang and played a number of instruments.          The Switzers took a trip to California in 1934 to visit with family members. While sightseeing they eventually wound up at Hal Roach Studios. Following a public tour of the facility, 8-year-old Harold and 6-year-old Carl entered into the Hal Roach Studio's public cafeteria, the ""Our Gang"" Café, and began an impromptu performance. Producer Hal Roach was present at the commissary that day and was impressed by the performance. He signed both Switzers to appear in ""Our Gang"". Harold was given two nicknames, ""Slim"" and ""Deadpan,"" and Carl was dubbed ""Alfalfa.""          The Switzer brothers first appeared in the 1935 ""Our Gang"" short, ""Beginner's Luck"". By the end of the year, Carl was one of the main characters in the series, while Harold had more or less been relegated to the role of a background player. Both Carl and Harold outgrew the series by 1940, with Slim's last appearance in ""The New Pupil"".          Though not saddled with the same problems his younger brother was faced with due to being typecast as a ""child star,"" Harold had his own problems. For several years, he operated a Speed Queen Company franchise, installing and servicing washers and dryers. In 1967, after killing a customer over a dispute, Switzer drove himself to a remote area near Glendale, California and committed suicide. He was 42.          Harold ""Slim"" Switzer is interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California, alongside his brother Carl.          Swtizer was married to Beverly Osso for over 10 years. The union brought three children: Judith Ann, Tony Frederick and Teddy Berton.

6592,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6592,Cyclades,"The Cyclades (; , ) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece. They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name refers to the islands ""around"" (κυκλάς) the sacred island of Delos. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the Aegean cat) originated.          The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (""Minoan"") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.          A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer wheat and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on Keos) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.          The first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898–1899 and coined the term ""Cycladic civilization"". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Brâncuși. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from Asia Minor c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.  3300 – 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called Helladic culture.          In recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.          The Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Eschati, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santoríni. The name ""Cyclades"" refers to the islands forming a circle (""circular islands"") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.          Ermoupolis, on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.          The islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco. Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.          The Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete.          The Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:          The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.           ""Note:"" Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.

He is best remembered for having passed strictures against the sitting Peshwa of the time for instigating murder. Ram Shastri's integrity in public affairs is regarded as a model for all times.          Ramshastri Prabhune was born in the small town of Mahuli, near Satara. Little is known of his early life, with references to him being available only after he entered the service of the Peshwas.          Ram Shastri held office under the Peshwas during the latter part of the 18th century. Known for his honesty and integrity, he even declined a royal gift made to his wife. He turned down the offer of an official mansion and continued to live in his humble ancestral home in the Brahmin quarter of Poona city on his modest income. It is said that his wife sold milk from their two cows and a buffalo in order to supplement his monthly income. This Brahminical frugality complemented his wide and eclectic scholarship: he was renowned for his knowledge of law (including British law), philosophy, and the theories of statecraft and political science. He was proficient in the Sanskrit, Marathi, Hindi, Urdu and English languages. As a young Brahmin student of Advaita vedanta, he had studied the Vedas, Upanishads and Puranas and was so well-versed in the Hindu scriptures, that he was considered as an authority in Pune in those times. He once debated for five days with Shri Varadendra Teertha, pontiff of the Madhva sect. After the debate, as a mark of respect and tribute to the scholarship of the pontiff he gave up his house and the structure is surviving to this day as the Shri Varadendra Swamy Mutt on Laxmi Road in Pune. To this theological scholarship, he added in later life a reading of the Quran and the Bible.          Ram Shastri's most famous act of passing the death sentence on the ruling Peshwa of the time, Raghunath Rao, for the murder of his own nephew, Peshwa Narayan Rao. In 1772, Peshwa Madhavrao I died, leaving his brother Narayan Rao, a minor, as heir. Madhavrao's paternal uncle, Peshwa Raghunath Rao, was appointed regent in the minority of his nephew. The following year, an act infamous in the history of the Maratha Empire was perpetrated when the young boy was murdered, at the behest either of the Regent or of his wife Anandibai, by Raghunath Rao's guardsmen. On the quiet winter night of 17 December 1772, the assassins entered his private quarters at Shaniwarwada in Pune; the boy-Peshwa ran for safety to the apartments of his uncle and aunt, knowing little about the true origin of the plot. These guardsmen then committed the murder in the very presence of Raghunath Rao and Anandibai.          Narayan Rao's wife delivered a son shortly after the death of her husband.

The name of the grenade came from Sidol, a metal-cleaning agent from Henkel sold in Poland at the time. The first grenades used the Sidol bottles as the casing. Later on the casing was purposely modelled after the bottle in order to allow for easier hiding of the weapon.           Sidolówka was first produced in Warsaw in 1942, by the professors of the Warsaw University of Technology under the leadership of Jan Czochralski. It was partially based on an earlier design of the Filipinka grenade, also of underground construction, which in turn was based on a pre-war Polish ET-38 anti-tank grenade. The primer and the detonator were designed by two engineers of the pre-war Polish munition works in Warsaw, pyrotechnician Władysław Pankowski and engineer Józef Michałowski.          It was a fragmentation grenade with a P-42 friction primer and a 4.5 second delay time. Until the end of the World War II, an estimate of 350,000 R-42 were produced in Polish underground factories.

1130361,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130361,Running Wild (band),"Running Wild is a German heavy metal band, formed in 1976 in Hamburg. They were part of the German metal scene to emerge in the early to mid-1980s. Over the course of their career, they have released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, and six singles/EPs. Although their earlier releases contained Satanic themes and imagery, Gerald ""Preacher"" Warnecke, the guitar player of the band, was studying theology at the time and is now a vicar in Cologne.          In 1987, the band released the album ""Under Jolly Roger,"" which was a switch to pirate-based and historical themes, creating and influencing the later named Pirate metal subgenre of heavy metal in the 2000s in the process. While the historical lyrics were very superficial at first, the lyrics for later albums were intensively researched, by Rolf Kasparek in particular.          After this album, from 1988 to 1992 (for the albums ""Port Royal"", ""Death or Glory"", ""Blazon Stone"" and ""Pile of Skulls""), Running Wild mainly wrote historically based lyrics. In addition to lyrics about pirates like Calico Jack, Klaus Störtebeker, or the little-known Henry Jennings, the band also addressed subjects like the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of Waterloo, or the colonization of the New World by the Conquistadors.          On 17 April 2009 Rolf announced that Running Wild had split up. Their intended last show was at Wacken Open Air on July 30, 2009. It was recorded for CD and DVD release and appeared as ""The Final Jolly Roger"" on June 24, 2011.          As of 21 October 2011, Running Wild have reformed. Their most recent album, titled ""Resilient"", was released in October 2013.          Running Wild played live for the Wacken Open Air festival in July of 2015.

23129431,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23129431,Cognitive appraisal,"Cognitive appraisal is the personal interpretation of a situation; it is how an individual views a situation. ""Appraisals refer to direct, immediate, and intuitive evaluations made on the environment in reference to personal well-being."" They are ""evaluative frameworks that people utilize to make sense of events."" Appraisals provide a glimpse of how people subjectively experience their environments and are strong correlates of emotions.          Cognitive appraisal is regarded by some sport psychologists as an important component of burnout. The perception of a situation can be the cause of a negative psychological reaction, rather than the situation itself. An athlete who loses a string of competitions can view it positively as a challenge and an opportunity to come back from adversity, or view it negatively as evidence that he or she will never be a successful competitor.          Cognitive appraisals determine if an event will be perceived as stressful. When distress is high, some individuals may be motivated to enter psychotherapy, and some psychotherapists may explicitly target cognitive appraisals when providing treatment. Per Dienes, Torres-Harding, Reinecke, Freeman, and Sauer (2011), “cognitive therapies . . . focus on an individual’s beliefs about the self, the world, and the future. The sources of pathology, and therefore the targets of therapy, are thoughts – maladaptive cognitions – that are frequently automatic and ingrained”. When maladaptive cognitive appraisals are thought to cause or maintain distress, impairment, or psychopathology, therapists may assist clients to question the evidence related to an appraisal, notice when irrational fantasies about potential consequences of some situation are linked to the experience of distress or impairment, and begin to respond to these situations in a more rational manner.          Patterns of emotion have long been researched with an interest in describing emotional experiences in terms of underlying dimensions. Traditionally theorists have only looked into two dimensions, pleasantness and arousal. With the review of two theorists, Roseman and Scherer, there has been a new proposal of a now eight cognitive appraisal dimensions to distinguish emotional understanding. “Most people refer to emotions in categorical terms: ‘I was scared’ or ‘I was sad’.” Most categorical theorists explain emotions as unstructured collections of distinct beings and, therefore, fail to capture the similarities and differences of emotions. A dimensional view of emotions is not incompatible with a categorical view. “Interrelations among emotions are not new. In 1896 Wundt proposed a three-dimensional structure of emotions, and in 1941 Schlosber began a series of investigations into the structural interrelations among emotions.” Pleasantness and level of activation (or arousal) are the only dimensions that have been found consistently across studies.           There have been studies done on categorical and dimensional factors, but a third group of theorists identify with neither approach. They argue that emotional differences must undeniably involve differences in the way an organism appraises its environment. The descriptions of the individual emotions demonstrate that that each emotion is characterized by a unique pattern of cognitive appraisals. Theorists must take into consideration all three patters and the role that each cognitive appraisal (dimension, categorical or environmental) plays in distinguishing among emotions.           1.Valence: positive vs. negative           2.Activation: aroused vs. relaxed          The term appraisal rebound effects refers to the stronger activation of an appraisal as a result of trying to suppress it. At times appraisal rebounds effects can continue psychopathological symptoms. An example of this can be when patients with stress try to remove negative thoughts from their mind but fail to do so and observe the disorder symptoms appearing on the same scale or even greater at times.          Wegner hypothesizes that suppressing appraisals involve two mechanisms. The first is the conscious suppression of the appraisal and seeking distractors to avoid appraisal. The second mechanism is the unconscious process of searching for the appraisal, and when finding one, it alerts the conscious mechanism to find more distractors. This process requires too much cognitive resources, and so the distractors often fail, and the appraisal can become hyperaccessible, perpetuating the appraisal.          Chronic appraisals are related to the chronic emotions of individuals since the way they chronically perceive situations affect their emotions. When individuals who tend to appraise situations in negative ways try to suppress the appraisal, they will be more likely to appraise another event negatively as well, and perpetuate their negative emotions.          The appraisal view of stress was developed by Richard Lazarus. He suggested that an individual's stress level is directly affected by their cognitive appraisal of the event that triggers the stress.          There are two stages of cognitive appraisal:          Primary appraisals. The initial evaluation of the situation comprises an assessment of the threat in the present situation.          Three kinds can be distinguished:          When an event is perceived as negative in the primary appraisal process, the individual moves to stage 2.          Evaluation of the individual's ability to cope with a situation, and of whether or not the individual has the materials to deal with the stimulus causing the stress. Secondary appraisal interacts with the primary appraisal to determine the emotional reaction to event.          This further appraisal is made in regard to:          During stage 2, if the individual finds that they do not have the materials to cope with the stimulus causing stress, it will determine the level of stress that is experienced. An example of this would be the reaction to snakes, which shows a great variation. A harmless garter snake might cause fear in some people and nothing in others.          Afterward, reappraisals occur: a continuous re-evaluation of the situation based on new information.          Cognitive responses to stress include beliefs          Some responses to stress are a conscious effort to cope with the stress.          Steve Williams suggests top professional golfers do not morally judge a shot after it comes to rest. According to Williams:          ""In the top golfers' eyes all shots are equal, and none is more equal that the others --- something that fits nicely into my native Kiwi egalitarianism. And since all golf shots are equal,there's no point in making value judgements on them. The top golfers just gather the data, and deliberately suppress any tendency to be either encouraged or discouraged by it. It's just data: it doesn't have a moral value.""          This statement suggest that top athlete's use cognitive appraisal to devalue a particular situation or outcome neither judging it being good or bad. A situation or in this case, a singular golf shot, is what it is and nothing else. In professional golf, if the player were to allow a previous shot to dictate emotional levels, that player would experience a roller coaster of emotions on every hole since no shot, other than a hole in one, is considered perfect. By removing emotion and not placing a judgmental value on performance, like a particulate golf shot, the athlete is not held hostage psychologically by up and down swings in athletic performance or outcomes that sometimes are out of the athlete's control.",['Psychology articles needing attention']

1640,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1640,Alfred the Great,"Alfred the Great (849 – 26 October 899) (, ""elf counsel"" or ""wise elf"") was King of Wessex from 871 to 899.          Alfred successfully defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in England. He is one of only two English monarchs to be given the epithet ""the Great"", the other being the Scandinavian Cnut the Great. He was also the first King of the West Saxons to style himself ""King of the Anglo-Saxons"". Details of Alfred's life are described in a work by the 10th-century Welsh scholar and bishop Asser. Alfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education and improved his kingdom's legal system, military structure and his people's quality of life.          Alfred was born in the village of Wanating, now Wantage, Oxfordshire. He was the youngest son of King Æthelwulf of Wessex, by his first wife, Osburh.          In 853, at the age of four, Alfred is said to have been sent to Rome where, according to the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"". he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV who ""anointed him as king"". Victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. However, his succession could not have been foreseen at the time, as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a ""consul""; a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion. It may also be based on Alfred's later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome, where he spent some time at the court of Charles the Bald, King of the Franks, around 854–855.          On their return from Rome in 856, Æthelwulf was deposed by his son Æthelbald. With civil war looming, the magnates of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. When King Æthelwulf died in 858, Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred.          Bishop Asser tells the story of how as a child Alfred won as a prize a book of Saxon poems, offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it. Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from Crohn's disease. Statues of Alfred in Winchester and Wantage portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong, and though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.          During the short reigns of the older two of his three elder brothers, Æthelbald of Wessex and Æthelberht of Wessex, Alfred is not mentioned. An army of Danes which the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" described as the Great Heathen Army had landed in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms that constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865. It was with the backdrop of a rampaging Viking army that Alfred's public life began, with the accession of his third brother, Æthelred of Wessex, in 865.          During this period, Bishop Asser applied to Alfred the unique title of ""secundarius"", which may indicate a position akin to that of the Celtic ""tanist"", a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father, or by the Witan, to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle. The arrangement of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well known among other Germanic tribes, such as the Swedes and Franks, to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related.          In 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army, led by Ivar the Boneless, out of the adjoining Kingdom of Mercia. At the end of 870, the Danes arrived in his homeland. The year which followed has been called ""Alfred's year of battles"". Nine engagements were fought, with varying outcomes, though the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded.          In Berkshire, a successful skirmish at the Battle of Englefield on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and Battle of Reading by Ivar's brother Halfdan Ragnarsson on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the Battle of Ashdown on the Berkshire Downs, possibly near Compton or Aldworth. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.          Later that month, on 22 January, the Saxons were defeated at the Battle of Basing. They were defeated again on 22 March at the Battle of Merton (perhaps Marden in Wiltshire or Martin in Dorset). Æthelred died shortly afterwards on 23 April.          In April 871, King Æthelred died, and Alfred succeeded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold. This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at ""Swinbeorg"". The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the ongoing Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.          While he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot, and then again in his presence at Wilton in May. The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. He was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the 'pagans' agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.          Indeed, the Viking army did withdraw from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year. Hoards dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at Croydon, Gravesend, and Waterloo Bridge. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years, the Danes occupied other parts of England.          In 876 under their new leader, Guthrum, the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied Wareham in Dorset. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault. Accordingly, he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a ""holy ring"" associated with the worship of Thor. The Danes, however, broke their word and, after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to Exeter in Devon.          Alfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon, and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878, the Danes made a sudden attack on Chippenham, a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas, ""and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at Athelney in the marshes of Somerset, and from that fort kept fighting against the foe"". From his fort at Athelney, an island in the marshes near North Petherton, Alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement, rallying the local militias from Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.          A legend, originating from 12th century chronicles, tells how when he first fled to the Somerset Levels, Alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom, Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn, and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return.          878 was the low-water mark in the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.          In the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around Whitsuntide, Alfred rode to 'Egbert's Stone' east of Selwood, where he was met by ""all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of Hampshire which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of Southampton Water), and they rejoiced to see him"". Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns (who were charged with levying and leading these forces), but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.          Alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing Battle of Edington which may have been fought near Westbury, Wiltshire. He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at Chippenham and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to Christianity. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near Athelney, with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.          According to Asser:          The unbinding of the Chrisom took place with great ceremony eight days later at the royal estate at Wedmore           While at Wedmore Alfred and Guthrum negotiated what some historians have called the Treaty of Wedmore, however it was to be some years after the ceasing of hostilities that a formal treaty was actually signed. . Under the terms of the so-called Treaty of Wedmore, the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex and return to East Anglia. Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester. The formal Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, preserved in Old English in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (Manuscript 383), and in a Latin compilation known as ""Quadripartitus"", was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King Ceolwulf II of Mercia was deposed.          That treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the River Thames, to the River Lea; follow the Lea to its source (near Luton); from there extend in a straight line to Bedford; and from Bedford follow the River Ouse to Watling Street.          In other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom, consisting of western Mercia; and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged kingdom of East Anglia (henceforward known as the Danelaw). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints—at least for the time being. The disposition of Essex, held by West Saxon kings since the days of Egbert, is unclear from the treaty, though, given Alfred's political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.          With the signing of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling East Anglia, Guthrum was neutralised as a threat. The Viking army, that had stayed at Fulham during the Winter of 878-879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879-892.          Alfred was still forced to contend with a number of Danish threats. A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships ""on the high seas"". Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces. Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period as they had for decades.          In the year 883, though there is some debate over the year, King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from Pope Marinus. Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the true cross, a true treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus' friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.          After the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace, the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in Kent, an allied kingdom in South East England, during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of Rochester, where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion, Alfred led an Anglo-Saxon force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.          Not long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder. After travelling up the River Stour, the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued. The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and as Huntingdon accounts, ""laden with spoils"". The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour, and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.          A year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again. Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the River Thames.          This is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred. This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact he would never adopt the title for himself.           Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, Æthelswith, en route to Rome in 888. In the same year the Archbishop of Canterbury, Æthelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in Hadleigh, Suffolk.          Guthrum's passing changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power–hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close, and war was on the horizon.          After another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser, under Hastein, at Milton, also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them, indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.          While he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck northwestwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, Edward, and were defeated in a general engagement at Farnham in Surrey. They took refuge on an island at Thorney, on the River Colne between Buckinghamshire and Middlesex, where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex. They then went to Essex and, after suffering another defeat at Benfleet, joined with Hastein's force at Shoebury.          Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes were besieging Exeter and an unnamed stronghold on the North Devon shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the Siege of Exeter. The fate of the other place is not recorded.          Meanwhile, the force under Hastein set out to march up the Thames Valley, possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of Mercia, Wiltshire and Somerset, and forced to head off to the northwest, being finally overtaken and blockaded at Buttington. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the River Wye, others with Buttington near Welshpool.) An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined Roman walls of Chester. The English did not attempt a winter blockade, but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.          Early in 894 or 895, lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to Essex. At the end of the year, the Danes drew their ships up the River Thames and River Lea and fortified themselves twenty miles (32 km) north of London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed but, later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at Cwatbridge near Bridgnorth. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to Northumbria, some to East Anglia. Those who had no connections in England withdrew back to the continent.          The Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended. The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire, in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.          According to the law code of King Ine of Wessex, issued in about 694:          Wessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids, the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a shield wall, advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence.          In contrast, the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.          These bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, ramparts and palisades. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.          The means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom; however, in the case of hit and run raids by Vikings, problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough: It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the newly assembled fyrd arrived. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878, many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.          With these lessons in mind, Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome, Alfred had stayed with Charles the Bald and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem, and learning from their experience was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also, there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892, Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.          Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding; the so-called ""common burdens"" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ""trinoda neccessitas"" or ""trimoda neccessitas"". The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was ""fierdwite"" or ""fyrdwitee"".          To maintain the burhs, and to reorganize the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The hide would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned.          At the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was the network of burhs, distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom. There were thirty-three in total, spaced approximately apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day.          Alfred's burhs (later termed boroughs) ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches probably reinforced with wooden revetments and palisades such as at Burpham, Sussex. The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton to large fortifications in established towns, the largest at Winchester.          A contemporary document now known as the Burghal Hidage provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the hidage for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2400 which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining of wall. A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed system wide, or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.          Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by Charles the Bald a generation before. The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas allowing the king better control over his strongholds.          The burhs were also interconnected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ""herepaths""). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled sometimes from more than one burh to confront the Viking invader. This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders. However, the Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against the burh and a developed doctrine of siegecraft, having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission, but this allowed the king time to send assistance with his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the well maintained army roads. In such cases, the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces. Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and successfully stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in Kent, the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia          Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for ""the common needs of the kingdom"".          Alfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896, he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships, that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the English Navy. Wessex possessed a royal fleet before this. King Athelstan of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851, capturing nine ships, and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.          But, clearly, the author of the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" and probably Alfred himself regarded 897 as marking an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The chronicler flattered his royal patron by boasting that Alfred's ships were not only larger, but swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of Greek and Roman warships, with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.          Alfred had seapower in mind—if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from ravaging. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.          The warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, at which point the crew would lash the two ships together before boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.          In the one recorded naval engagement in the year 896, Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships in the mouth of an unidentified river along the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships, and gone inland, either to rest their rowers or to forage for food. Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape to the sea. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.          Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded the enemy's vessels and proceeded to kill everyone on board. The one ship that escaped managed to do so only because all of Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out. What ensued was a land battle between the crews of the grounded ships. The Danes, heavily outnumbered, would have been wiped out if the tide had not risen. When that occurred, the Danes rushed back to their boats, which being lighter, with shallower drafts, were freed before Alfred's ships. Helplessly, the English watched as the Vikings rowed past them. The pirates had suffered so many casualties (120 Danes dead against 62 Frisians and English), that they had difficulties putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at Selsey Bill). The shipwrecked sailors were brought before Alfred at Winchester and were hanged.          In the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ""domboc"" or law code, consisting of his ""own"" laws followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King Ine of Wessex. Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction, Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many ""synod-books"" and ""ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way"".          Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he ""found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or Offa, king of the Mercians, or King Æthelberht of Kent, who first among the English people received baptism."" He appended rather than integrated the laws of Ine into his code, and although he included, as had Æthelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian Patrick Wormald to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates.          About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction, which includes translations into English of the Decalogue, a few chapters from the Book of Exodus, and the ""Apostolic Letter"" from Acts of the Apostles (15:23–29). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law. It traces the continuity between God's gift of Law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it links the holy past to the historical present and represents Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.          Similarly, Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law. The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfred's code is the ""Apostolic Letter,"" which explained that Christ ""had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness"" (Intro, 49.1). The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes, since Christian synods ""established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation, which they then fixed"".          The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money is treachery to a lord, ""since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself"". Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment from ""Love your neighbour as yourself"" (Matt. 22:39–40) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship, which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.          When one turns from the ""domboc""'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradict the laws of Ine that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual, but as an ideological manifesto of kingship, ""designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction"". In practical terms, the most important law in the code may well be the very first: ""We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge,"" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.          Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves, and ""would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm, to see whether they were just or unjust"". A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber, while washing his hands.          Asser represents Alfred as a Solomonic judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code, he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves ""to the pursuit of wisdom."" The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.          The ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification (of England), whereas Asser's ""The Life of King Alfred"" promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way, so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.          Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers, but little definite information is available. His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius. He corresponded with Elias III, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the Pope were fairly frequent. Around 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby undertook a journey from Hedeby on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town of Truso. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.          Alfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of Britain are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the southern Welsh princes, owing to the pressure on them from North Wales and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign the North Welsh followed their example, and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of the three pilgrim ""Scots"" (i.e. Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint Modwenna, though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.          In the 880s, at the same time that he was ""cajoling and threatening"" his nobles to build and man the burhs, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of Charlemagne almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning. It entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the episcopacy; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed ""most necessary for all men to know""; the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to Adam, thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.          Very little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries, and though Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century. According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.          Alfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.          He was equally comfortable distributing his translation of Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care"" to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests, and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal thegns and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.          The Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ""Pastoral Care"" that ""learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English, or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either"". Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated for dramatic effect the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth. That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige.          Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century. Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. And a solemn diploma from Christ Church, Canterbury dated 873 is so poorly constructed and written that historian Nicholas Brooks posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin. ""It is clear"", Brooks concludes, ""that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship"".          Following the example of Charlemagne, Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and ""a good many of lesser birth"". There they studied books in both English and Latin and ""devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts"". He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. Grimbald and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.          Alfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed ""to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it"". Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm, Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.           A problem, however, was that there were few ""books of wisdom"" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed ""most necessary for all men to know."" It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme, but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks.          Apart from the lost ""Handboc"" or ""Encheiridion,"" which seems to have been a commonplace book kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ""Dialogues"" of Gregory the Great, a book greatly popular in the Middle Ages. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by Werferth, Bishop of Worcester, with the king merely furnishing a preface. Remarkably, Alfred, undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars, translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care"", Boethius's ""Consolation of Philosophy"", St. Augustine's ""Soliloquies"", and the first fifty psalms of the Psalter.          One might add to this list Alfred's translation, in his law code, of excerpts from the Vulgate Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of Orosius's ""Histories against the Pagans"" and Bede's ""Ecclesiastical History of the English People"" are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences. Nonetheless, the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest this also for Bald's ""Leechbook"" and the anonymous ""Old English Martyrology"".          Alfred's first translation was of Pope Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care,"" which he prefaced with an introduction explaining why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this one from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating ""sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense,"" Alfred's translation actually keeps very close to his original, although through his choice of language he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant his translation to be used and circulated it to all his bishops. Interest in Alfred's translation of ""Pastoral Care"" was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.          Boethius' ""Consolation of Philosophy"" was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike his translation of the ""Pastoral Care"", Alfred here deals very freely with his original and though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred himself, but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is solely Alfred's and highly characteristic of his style. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: ""To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works"". The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these the writing is prose, in the other a combination of prose and alliterating verse.          The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the authorship of the verse has been much disputed; but likely it also is by Alfred. In fact, he writes in the prelude that he first created a prose work and then used it as the basis for his poem ""Metres of Boethius"". He spent a great deal of time working on these books, which he tells us he gradually wrote through the many stressful times of his reign to refresh his mind. Of the authenticity of the work as a whole, there seems to be little doubt.          The last of Alfred's works is one to which he gave the name ""Blostman"", i.e., ""Blooms"" or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the ""Soliloquies"" of St Augustine of Hippo, the remainder is drawn from various sources, and contains much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. ""Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear"". Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ""The Owl and the Nightingale,"" where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ""The Proverbs of Alfred"", a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom).          The Alfred jewel, discovered in Somerset in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its Old English inscription ""AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN"" (""Alfred ordered me to be made""). The jewel is about long, made of filigreed gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set a cloisonné enamel plaque, with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.          It was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown, it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ""æstels""—pointers for reading—that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ""Pastoral Care"". Each ""æstel"" was worth the princely sum of 50 mancuses, which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel"".          Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs. As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care"", kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people. The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: ""Study Wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it"".          The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the Carolingian renaissance. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience, but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.          Asser wrote of Alfred in his ""Life of King Alfred"":          It is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as ""shameful negligence"" of his parents and tutors. It is true, however, that Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory, and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; ""I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest."" After excitedly asking, ""Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?"" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.          Alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: ""[these] he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it"".          An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody’s skills could compare.          Although he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. Despite eventually becoming one of the greatest warriors and forgers of peace in the kingdom, he was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record them until later in life. Asser writes that ""[Alfred] could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time"".          In 868, Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucil, Ealdorman of the Gaini. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.          They had five or six children together, including Edward the Elder, who succeeded his father as king, Æthelflæd, who became Lady (ruler) of the Mercians in her own right, and Ælfthryth who married Baldwin II the Count of Flanders. His mother was Osburga daughter of Oslac of the Isle of Wight, Chief Butler of England. Asser, in his ""Vita Ælfredi"" asserts that this shows his lineage from the Jutes of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as Bede tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under Cædwalla. In 2008 the skeleton of Queen Eadgyth, granddaughter of Alfred the Great was found in Magdeburg Cathedral in Germany. It was confirmed in 2010 that these remains belong to her — one of the earliest members of the English royal family.          Osferth was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother, ""mistakenly"" according to Keynes and Lapidge, but in the view of Janet Nelson, he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.          Alfred died on 26 October 899. How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness. His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either Crohn's disease or haemorrhoidal disease. His grandson King Eadred seems to have suffered from a similar illness.          Alfred was originally buried temporarily in the Old Minster in Winchester; then, four years after his death, he was moved to the New Minster (perhaps built especially to receive his body). When the New Minster moved to Hyde, a little north of the city, in 1110, the monks were transferred to Hyde Abbey, along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of Henry VIII, the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.          The royal graves and many others were probably rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850. Further excavations in 1866 and 1897 were inconclusive. In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These later came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church, who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.          Excavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation. The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones. Bones suggested at the time to be those of Alfred proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.          In March 2013, the Diocese of Winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage. The Diocese made no claim they were the bones of Alfred, but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of King Richard III. The bones were subsequently radiocarbon dated, but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore unrelated to Alfred. However, it was announced in January 2014 that a fragment of pelvis unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, that had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, had been radiocarbon dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son Edward, but this remains unproven.          Alfred is venerated as a saint by some Christian traditions, however an attempt by Henry VI of England in 1441 to have him canonized by the pope was unsuccessful. The Anglican Communion venerates him as a Christian hero, with a feast day of 26 October, and he may often be found depicted in stained glass in Church of England parish churches.          Alfred commissioned Bishop Asser to write his biography, which inevitably emphasised Alfred's positive aspects. Later medieval historians, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation Alfred was seen as being a pious Christian ruler, who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as 'the Great', rather than any of Alfred's contemporaries. The epithet was retained by succeeding generations of Parliamentarians and empire-builders who saw Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education and establishment of the rule of law as supporting their own ideals.          A number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour. These include:          The Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments HMS King Alfred, and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named USS Alfred in his honour.          In 2002, Alfred the Great was ranked number 14 in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.          A statue of Alfred the Great, situated in the Wantage market place, was sculpted by Count Gleichen, a relative of Queen Victoria's, and unveiled on 14 July 1877 by the Prince and Princess of Wales.          The statue was vandalised on New Year's Eve 2007, losing part of its right arm and axe. After the arm and axe were replaced the statue was again vandalised on Christmas Eve 2008, losing its axe.

676409,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=676409,Bane (comics),"Bane is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman. The character's origin was in ""Batman: Vengeance of Bane"" #1 (January 1993), and was created by Chuck Dixon, Doug Moench, and Graham Nolan.          Known for his mix of brute strength and exceptional intelligence, the character is often credited as being the only villain to have ""Broken the Bat"". IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Bane as #34. Bane was portrayed by Robert Swenson in the 1997 film ""Batman & Robin"" and by Tom Hardy in the 2012 film ""The Dark Knight Rises"".          Chuck Dixon, Graham Nolan, and Doug Moench created the character for the """" storyline, although it is unsure what elements were introduced by each of the two writers (Dixon and Moench). Dixon wrote the character's first appearance (""Vengeance of Bane""), with art by Graham Nolan. It is also unclear how much input was provided by Denny O'Neil (veteran writer of the ""Batman"" books, then Group Editor for the ""Batman"" family of books, and author of the novel adaptation of ""Knightfall""). O'Neil had previously created Bane's hellish birthplace of Santa Prisca in ""The Question"" and the drug Venom in the storyline of the same name (published in the pages of ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" #16-20, and later reprinted as a trade paperback). In the pages of ""Azrael"", O'Neil introduced Bane's perception of Venom as both an addiction and the weakness responsible for his earlier defeats.          Bane's origin story is established in the story ""Knightfall"". He was born in the fictional Caribbean Republic of Santa Prisca, in a prison called Peña Duro. His father, Edmund Dorrance (better known as King Snake), had been a revolutionary who had escaped Santa Prisca's court system. The corrupt government decreed that his young son would serve out the man's life sentence, and thus Bane's childhood and early adult life were spent in the immoral penitentiary environment.          Though he was imprisoned, his natural abilities allowed him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison's walls. He read as many books as he could get his hands on, spent most of his spare time body building in the prison's gym, developed his own form of meditation, and learned to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Because of the cultural and supposed geographical location of Santa Prisca, Bane knew how to speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and Latin. Despite his circumstances, he found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly Jesuit priest, under whose tutelage he apparently received a classical education. Bane murdered this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. He committed his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison. During his years in prison, Bane carried a teddy bear he called Osito (""Little bear"" in Spanish), whom he considered his only friend. It is revealed that Osito has a hole in his back to hold a knife that Bane used to defend himself.          Bane is tortured by a monstrous, terrifying bat creature that appears in his dreams, thus giving him chiroptophobia (fear of bats). He ultimately established himself as the ""king"" of Peña Duro prison and became known as Bane. The prison's controllers took note and eventually forced him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed all other subjects; the drug was administered by a doctor who bore a passing resemblance to another Batman foe, Hugo Strange. Later, in ""Vengeance of Bane II"" the very same doctor encountered Bane again in Gotham City and it is confirmed that it is not Hugo Strange, who, at that point in Batman continuity, was a crazed psychologist and not a surgeon. The Peña Duro prison Venom experiment nearly killed Bane at first, but he survived and found that the drug vastly increases his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours (via a system of tubes pumped directly into his brain) or he will suffer debilitating side-effects.          During the """" storyline, Bane escaped Peña Duro, along with several accomplices based on the Fabulous Five (his minions Trogg, Zombie and Bird, all of whom are named after 1960s rock bands — The Troggs, The Zombies and The Byrds — and were designed to mimic three of Doc Savage's assistants Monk, Ham, and Renny). His ambition turned to destroying Batman, about whom he had heard stories from an inmate. Gotham fascinated Bane because, like Peña Duro, fear rules Gotham - but it is the fear of the Batman. Bane was convinced that Batman was a personification of the demonic bat which had haunted his dreams since childhood. Therefore, Bane believed fate placed Batman on a collision course with him.          Aware that a direct assault on Batman would be foolish, Bane instead destroyed the walls of Arkham Asylum—allowing its deranged inmates (including the Joker, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist, Firefly, Poison Ivy, Cornelius Stirk, Film Freak and Victor Zsasz) to escape into Gotham City. Consequently, Batman was forced to recapture the escapees, a mission that took him three months. Exhausted, Batman returned to his home in the Batcave then went up to Wayne Manor as Bruce Wayne, where he found Bane waiting for him (who had previously figured out his secret identity). Bane attacked Bruce, first in Wayne Manor but then the two tumbled down into the Batcave below, where Bane continued his assault on Bruce Wayne, toying with him throughout. Bane delivered the final blow by raising Bruce up and throwing him down upon his knee, breaking his back and he left him a paraplegic. Bane thus becomes the only man to have ""Broken the Bat"". This iconic moment is incorporated in ""The Dark Knight Rises"", Robot Chicken's ""DC Comics Special"" and alluded to numerous times in the DCAU cartoons.          While Bane established himself as the new ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passed the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley, also known as Azrael. As the ""new"" Batman, however, Jean-Paul grew increasingly violent and ruthless; he believed that the only way to defeat criminals is to go to their level. Valley also refused to recognize Tim Drake/Robin as his partner. Despite Bruce Wayne's strict orders that Valley avoid Bane, he disregarded those commands and boldly attempted to confront Bane in his home; with the villain then living in luxury high above Gotham in a penthouse suite. Valley had by then added a set of high-tech, heavy metal gauntlets to the Batsuit, and used them to shoot sharp projectiles at Bane. But Bane was able to get the upper hand in the fight after using Venom and taunting Valley, making him angry enough to rush him. Despite besting Valley, Bane sustained deep lacerations in the battle and lost a great deal of blood. Unable to go to a hospital, Bane increased his Venom intake to temporarily block the pain and buy himself time to defeat the new Batman. Humiliated, Valley returned to the Batcave where he built an advanced combat suit of metal, in place of the traditional Batsuit, with many chambers within the suit that fire razor-sharp weapons. Reduced to little more than a wounded animal fleeing for survival, Bane was no match against the ""new"" Batman and was overwhelmed by him. Bane was finally defeated when Valley severed the tubes that pump Venom into his bloodstream, causing severe withdrawal. Commissioner James Gordon, Harvey Bullock, and the Tim Drake Robin watched in horror as this new Batman tortured a defeated Bane, who begs Valley to kill him. Valley denied his innate urge to kill Bane, however, and left him to be arrested.          Bane became an Arkham Asylum inmate and plotted his escape and revenge on Batman and his allies. Jean-Paul Valley lost the mantle of the Bat whilst Bruce Wayne is fully recovered.          Further following the events of ""Knightfall"", Bane recovers from his Venom addiction while serving time in Blackgate Prison, as seen in ""Vengeance of Bane II: The Redemption"" (1995). He eventually escapes from prison and returns to Gotham, where he fights alongside Batman to take out a criminal ring that is distributing a Venom derivative to street-level thugs. Following a victory over the criminals (and the revelation that behind it is the same doctor that performed the surgery on Bane years earlier in Peña Dura), Bane proclaims that he is ""innocent"" of his past crimes and urges Batman to stop hunting him. He then leaves Gotham (without fighting Batman) to begin a search for his dead father.          Bane's search brings him back to Santa Prisca. In search of leads, Bane questions the Jesuit priest who had taught him while he was in Peña Dura. The priest explains that there were four men who could possibly have been his father: a Santa Priscan revolutionary, an American doctor, an English mercenary and a Swiss banker. While searching for the Swiss man in Rome, Bane encounters Talia al Ghul and the League of Assassins and eventually impresses Ra's al Ghul so much that he chooses Bane to marry Talia and become his heir (an ""honor"" he had previously bestowed on Batman).          Ra's al Ghul then launches a plague attack on Gotham in the ""Legacy"" storyline, with Bane at his side, who is posing as Ubu. Bruce Wayne, again costumed as Batman, gets his rematch with Bane in ""Detective Comics"" #701 and finally defeats him in single combat. The defeat causes Ra's to call off the engagement to Talia and disown Bane.          Following the ""Legacy"" storyline, Bane appears in a one-shot publication called ""Batman: Bane"" (1997) with the intent of destroying Gotham City using a nuclear reactor until the plan is stopped by Batman and his allies. He fights Azrael in the ""Angel and the Bane"" storyline. Bane then surfaces in the story arc ""No Man's Land"", serving as an enforcer for Lex Luthor during Luthor's attempts to take control of Gotham under the cover of helping it to rebuild, but Batman convinces Bane to leave after a brief confrontation between Bane and the Joker. Following the fallout with Ra's al Ghul, Bane later embarks on a campaign to destroy Lazarus Pits around the world, and in the process, encounters Black Canary.          According to the Jesuit priest, with whom Bane speaks, there is a possibility that Bane's biological father is an American doctor. In researching this issue, Bane comes to the conclusion that he and Batman share Dr. Thomas Wayne as their biological father, with Dr. Wayne allegedly becoming close to Bane's mother during his time in Santa Prisca. Bane alerts Batman to this possibility and during the time that the DNA tests are being performed, stays at Wayne Manor and fights alongside Batman on the streets of Gotham in the ""Tabula Rasa"" storyline. Ultimately, it is revealed that Dr. Wayne is not Bane's father, and Bane leaves Gotham peacefully (and with Batman's blessing and financial backing) to pursue leads in the snowy mountains of Kangchenjunga.          Bane eventually finds his father, who turns out to be the unscrupulous King Snake (validating the English mercenary hypothesis), and not El Jefe del País de Santa Prisca, in the ""Veritas Liberat"" storyline. Bane, with Batman looking on, helps foil King Snake's plans to unleash a powerful weapon upon the world. Bane saves Batman from being shot by King Snake, but is mortally wounded in the process. Batman then saves Bane by bathing him in a Lazarus Pit, and leaves him with a clean slate.          In ""Infinite Crisis"" #7, Bane fights alongside the villains during the Battle of Metropolis. During the battle, he breaks the back of the hero Judomaster, killing him. No reason was given for his actions in #7, though in ""Infinite Crisis""' collected edition, one of the many changes made to the original series was Bane saying ""I finally know who I am. I am 'Bane'. I 'break' people."" while breaking Judomaster's back.          Bane resurfaces in the ""One Year Later"" continuity of ""JSA Classified"" #17-18 searching for the Hourmen (Rex and Rick Tyler), asking them for help. To win their trust, he tells them how, prior to the Battle of Metropolis, he returned to his homeland to put an end to the drug lords' government and in the process discovered that a new, more addictive strain of Venom had been created. In his furious carelessness to wipe out the drug trade, he was captured, and re implanted with the cranial tubes, hooked to the new Venom, and now unable to shake off his addiction without dying from the withdrawal. Bane was forced to work as an enforcer for the drug cartel, unable to escape. Believing that Bane sought Rex Tyler's expertise in chemistry, Rick lets him approach his father, only to discover that the story is a ruse. Bane, who had never truly been addicted to Venom, had in fact wiped out the drug lords, and destroyed every research note on Venom. He discovered in the process both strains of Venom derived from Rex Tyler's early research on Miraclo. He discovers from the Tylers that no written notes exist of Rex' work, captures Rex, and steals Rick's equipment, planning to kill Rex and force Rick to take the last of the new Venom, living forever as an addict. Rick manipulates Bane into using Miraclo and demolishing the building as he and his father escape, burying the mercenary in the rubble of the very same Santa Priscan penitentiary where his story began.          Eventually, Bane resurfaces in Santa Prisca and leads the country to democratic elections. Upon discovering that the elections were rigged by Computron, he uses his influence to enforce martial law, plunging the country into a civil war. Computron offers information to Checkmate who ordered him to rig the elections in exchange for their help to escape the country. Fire and Judomaster's son, Thomas Jagger, are sent on the mission, with Jagger debating whether or not to seek revenge for his father's murder. He fights Bane in order to allow Fire to escape, defeating him easily, but chooses not to kill him.          At the end of the miniseries ""Suicide Squad: Raise the Flag"", Amanda Waller recruits Bane into the Squad. In ""Outsiders"" #50, he appears once more to be wearing the tubing system to apply Venom.          In ""Salvation Run"" #2, Bane was tricked by his fellow squad members, and sent to the prison planet. In ""Salvation Run"" #3, Bane remains with Lex Luthor's faction after the Joker's faction rebels against Luthor's leadership. He attacks Thunder and Lightning when they were attempting to feed Martian Manhunter.          ""Superman/Batman"" #53-#56 reveals Bane is trading his Venom supplies with drug lords around the globe. One of his shipments includes a trip to Gotham. Batman, who was temporarily endowed with Superman's powers, responded by attacking Bane at his home. Not only was the Dark Knight able to easily defeat the villain, the hero nearly killed him with his far superior strength. Bane survived his injuries due to the enhanced stamina from his Venom supplies.          Since September 2008, Bane has appeared as a regular character in the ongoing Secret Six series. In the first issue, Bane is depicted as a stoic devil's advocate for the group, offering alternative points of view for both Deadshot and Catman on the subject of love. He is later shown to have an almost father like concern for Scandal Savage's well-being. Although this is largely played for laughs in the early issues, the first arc's final issue displays the depth of Bane's affection. When the Six are attacked by an army of supervillains, a wounded (and seemingly dying) Bane's concern for Scandal results in temporarily breaking his vow to never take Venom again in order to save her. Bane is later shown to have recovered from his ordeal, appearing in Gotham City with Cat-Man and Ragdoll in an attempt to stem some of the chaos caused by the apparent death of Batman. During the team's several escapades, Bane reveals both a deep respect for his onetime adversary and a painful yearning to assume the mantle of Batman, telling a trio of rescued citizens to tell people that it was the Batman who saved them. Bane ultimately gives his blessing to Dick Grayson, praying that ""God help him."" Following a near-disastrous mission, Bane assumes leadership over the Six. His first act as leader is to remove Scandal from active duty, not wishing for her to be endangered. In the latest issue of ""Secret Six"", Bane's Secret Six and Scandal Savage's Secret Six finally square off against each other. Bane and Scandal engage in a one on one fight where he refuses to fight back until Scandal uses her Lamentation Blades to slash his throat. The card is ultimately used to resurrect Knockout.          Driven to near madness, Bane decides to lead the Secret Six to Gotham in an attempt to psychologically break Batman by killing several of his closest allies. The team kidnaps the Penguin, who Bane pumps for information about Batman's partners. In the final issue of the series, Bane ultimately decides on Red Robin, Azrael and Batgirl as his victims. Before the Six can make their move, Penguin betrays their location, resulting in a massive army of superheroes ranging from Green Lantern, Batman and the Superman family to the Justice League, Birds of Prey, and Booster Gold converging on Gotham. The Secret Six stage a desperate last stand, but are quickly defeated. With the fates of the other Secret Six members left ambiguous, Bane is last shown being driven away in a Gotham police van. The ending of the issue implies that he plans to escape.          In the company relaunch called The New 52, Bane is re-introduced in the DCU by Paul Jenkins, and David Finch's run on """" Volume 2. Here, he has a massive storage tank on his back and is still fighting his addiction to the Venom compound. As Bruce Wayne is unable to keep up with the various legal conspiracies involving Batman Incorporated, he decides to investigate a breakout in Arkham. There he finds criminals being fed a modified fear toxin that is mixed in with Venom which makes the criminals extremely strong and immune to fear. He finds it being given to criminals by a new foe named the White Rabbit, when Batman approaches her she quickly defeats him and injects him with the fear toxin which she then gives to the Flash. Bruce then finds Bane to be behind the new fear toxin and combats him, Bruce manages to burn the fear toxin out of his and the Flash's bodies by getting pushed to the limit. Bruce manages to defeat Bane and knock him off an edge, but is left confused by the White Rabbit. Bane is then washed away by the tide.          Bane later appears in ""Detective Comics (Vol. 2)"" #19, in the story ""War Council"". There, his look had been altered to include a vest and cargo pants, and he now has an army serving him. In the story, it's revealed in flashback that prior to his appearance in ""Batman: The Dark Knight"", Bane had intended to steal a nuclear device to threaten Gotham City, only to have a run-in with the Court of Owls, who prevented him from stealing the device and didn't want him to interfere with their plans. Later, after Batman defeats Bane, a mysterious figure confronts the villain and informs him that the Court of Owls had undermined his plans. Bane returns to Santa Prisca to lead his army against them.          During the ""Forever Evil"" storyline, Scarecrow learns that Bane may be the cause of the Blackgate uprising and will be their leader in the impending war, and that Talons were stored at Blackgate on ice. Bane, having escaped Peña Dura Prison in Santa Prisca, ships his Venom to Gotham City to be there for when he arrives. As he is traveling to Gotham, he orchestrates the release of Blackgate's prisoners during the Crime Syndicate's broadcast to the world. Later, on board his ship, he prepares his men for the impending war with Scarecrow, and with Gotham in the distant, claims it will be his. Bane enters Blackgate through the sewers to join the prisoners there. While there, he comes across where the Talons are stored hoping to make them in to his weapons. While the attack on Gotham City begins between Bane's men and the GCPD, Bane also approaches Professor Pyg, forcing him to join his cause, and spread word that everything in Gotham is now controlled by Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as Man-Bat and his fellow bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving. Bane retrieves Emperor Penguin for the Penguin as part of their agreement. When Bane brings Emperor Blackgate to the Penguin, the Penguin tells him that the Arkham fighters are not scared of Bane as he does not instill fear as Batman did. Realizing this, Bane constructs a batsuit for himself and heads to Wayne Tower to confront Killer Croc. Bane fights Killer Croc and is able to defeat him, setting his sights on retrieving the Talons. Bane wakes up the Talon William Cobb and takes him through Gotham where he fights members of Arkham Asylum. Bane begins recruiting Gotham citizens to his side, offering his base at Wayne Tower as a haven to the people to escape the rule of the Arkham inmates. He tells Cobb his plan to turn the city over to the Court, in exchange for use of Talons at his disposal to be powered by his Venom. The Talons attack Bane's men, and eventually set their target on Bane. With the help of Cobb, Bane is able to injure the Talons enough to activate their regenerative powers to remove the mind-control technology.          Bane is highly intelligent; in ""Bane of the Demon"", Ra's al Ghul says that Bane ""has a mind equal to the greatest he has known"" (although he dismisses Bane's intellect as the cunning of an animal rather than the cultured, trained intellect of Batman). His strength gives him more ways to go against Batman. Bane has shown to be capable of lifting 15 tons. In prison, he taught himself various scientific disciplines equal to the level of understanding of leading experts in those fields. He knows six active languages and at least two additional arcane and dead ones. Among these are Spanish, English, Persian, and Latin. The ""Bane of the Demon"" storyline reveals that he has an eidetic memory. Within one year, he is able to deduce Batman's secret identity.          He is also highly devious and a superb strategist and tactician. In prison, Bane also invented his own form of calisthenics, meditation, and a fighting style that he uses against other well-known martial arts fighters within the DC Universe. Bane creator Chuck Dixon's early tales portray Bane as a very calm, centered warrior akin to Bruce Lee; in as much that he draws strength through calm meditation, and the spiritual energy of the ""very rock of Peña Dura"". Dixon imbued Bane with an almost supernatural quality when he explained that Bane triumphed in all of his prison fights by employing these abilities, while his opponents had only rage and greed to propel them. Multiple scenes in ""Vengeance of Bane"" explore this aspect when it explains that Bane's mastery of meditation techniques ""made time and space playthings to him."" A subsequent scene that reinforces this ability comes when Bird first comes to Bane for help, because he heard from other inmates that Bane has ""magic... the kind that allows him to travel beyond the prison walls."" Usage of Venom enhances his physical abilities, including his strength and healing process, to superhuman levels.          Although Bane had sworn off using Venom in ""Vengeance of Bane II"" in 1995, and his character is actually written as having kept that promise to himself, it is still not uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device to the back of his head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of ""Secret Six"", in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.          In the ""Amalgam universe"", Bane was combined with Marvel Comics' Nuke as HYDRA's Bane Simpson, Another version of Bane was merged with Punisher called the ""Banisher"" appeared. He's described as a ""gun-toting, drugged up anti-hero who broke Bruce Wayne's back.""          In the ""Kingdom Come"" reality, an aged Bruce Wayne mentions to Superman that Bane and Two-Face broke into Wayne Manor and destroyed it, after Batman's identity was exposed, leaving only the Batcave intact.          Bane appeared in numerous ""Elseworlds"" including """" as a low-level criminal, a dead Bane appears in a brief cameo in ""JLA: Riddle of the Beast"", killed by Green Arrow.          Bane appears in ""Smallville"" comic ""Smallville Season Eleven"".          In ""Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", Bane was mutated into a humanoid mutant elephant.          Bane makes his first appearance in Year Five of the ""Injustice: Gods Among Us"" comic series. He decides allying himself with Superman's Regime will give him a position of power, so he aides the Man of Steel and Wonder Woman in subduing Doomsday. While initially suspicious of Bane's motivations, Superman is convinced Bane could be a valuable asset to the Regime and agrees. However, this decision does not bode well with the rest of the Regime, who openly resent the idea of working alongside their former enemies.","['Characters created by Chuck Dixon', 'Characters created by Doug Moench', 'Characters created by Graham Nolan', 'Comics characters introduced in 1993', 'DC Comics characters with accelerated healing', 'DC Comics characters with superhuman strength', 'DC Comics martial artists', 'Fictional assassins', 'Fictional bounty hunters', 'Fictional chemists', 'Fictional drug addicts', 'Fictional drug dealers', 'Fictional henchmen', 'Fictional Hispanic and Latino-American people', 'Fictional linguists', 'Fictional mercenaries', 'Fictional mixed martial artists', 'Superhero film characters', 'Video game bosses']"

Arch Getty,"John Archibald Getty, III (born November 30, 1950) is an American revisionist historian and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is noted for his research on Russian and Soviet history, especially the period under Joseph Stalin and the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.          Getty was born in Louisiana but grew up in Oklahoma. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and his Ph.D. from Boston College in 1979. Getty was a professor at the University of California, Riverside before moving to UCLA.          Getty established himself as a forerunner among revisionist historians of the Soviet Union with his first book, ""Origin of the Great Purges: The Soviet Communist Party Reconsidered, 1933-1938"" (Cambridge 1985). Most recently, Getty has published a biography of N.I. Yezhov (2008). He is a controversial figure in the field of Soviet studies, as he was one of the first to put forth the thesis that the Great Purge was planned and commanded not by Stalin, but by Yezhov and other Stalin's subordinates. According to Robert Conquest, ""Getty belongs to a gaggle of ‘revisionists’ who have achieved, like David Irving in another sphere, a certain notoriety. They are for some reason concerned to deny that much of a terror took place in the USSR in the Thirties, a stance only achievable by rejecting ... the vast corpus of evidence to the contrary.          In particular, Arch Getty tried to justify that Stalin was not culpable for Kirov's assassination, calling it ""complicated and at least secondhand."" Getty echoed Khrushchev's observation of NKVD complicity in the murder. However, he considered the confession by NKVD head, Genrikh Yagoda that he arranged the murder of Kirov as a proof of Stalin's innocence. Getty argued that it would have been ""very dangerous to allow [Yagoda] to appear later before the microphones of the world press"" if he had knowledge of Stalin's complicity because he ""knew that he would be shot anyway"" and ""it would have been easy for him to let slip that Stalin had put him up to it.""          Jonathan Haslam remarks on the paradox that Getty's work is rehabilitating Stalin's reputation just when Soviet historians were exposing the details of Stalin's crimes against the Soviet people.","['1950 births', 'Living people', 'American biographers', 'Male biographers', 'American historians', 'Boston College alumni', 'Guggenheim Fellows', 'Historians of communism', 'Historians of Russia', 'Writers from Louisiana', 'University of California, Los Angeles faculty', 'University of Pennsylvania alumni', 'Stalinism-era scholars and writers', 'Historical revisionism']"

Directed by Gordon Douglas as a sequel to 1935's ""Our Gang Follies of 1936"", the two-reel short was released to theaters on December 18, 1937 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.          Deriving its title from the concurrent MGM feature film ""The Broadway Melody of 1938"", ""Our Gang Follies of 1938"" is a spoof of the ""Broadway Melody"" films and other movie musicals of the time. In the film, Alfalfa (Carl Switzer) decides to quit a pop music revue put on by Spanky (George McFarland) and become an opera singer, famously singing a pastiche song entitled ""The Barber of Seville"" several times throughout the film. The bulk of the film is made up of a dream sequence, in which Alfalfa imagines himself twenty years later failing as an opera singer, while Spanky owns a Broadway nightclub with a lavish floor show.          The gang is putting on another big show in Spanky's cellar, complete with an orchestra led by Buckwheat (Billie Thomas), and performances by Darla (Darla Hood) and many of the other neighborhood kids. However, ""King of Crooners"" Alfalfa (Carl Switzer), the star of the show, crashes the swing music based show with his off-key rendition of ""The Barber of Seville"", having secretly decided he's going to sing opera from now on. Spanky closes the curtain on Alfalfa and sends out another act to replace him, causing Alfalfa to walk out and take his voice ""where it'll be appreciated!""          With Porky (Eugene Lee) accompanying him, Alfalfa turns up at the Cosmopolitan Opera House, wanting to appear in their next opera. Barnaby (Henry Brandon), the Cosmopolitan's impresario, jokingly offers the young boy a contract - provided he come back in twenty years. Elated, Alfalfa returns to Spanky's cellar with Porky, gloating about his presumed good fortune. Spanky tears into him, telling him that ""someday I'll be a big producer on Broadway, and you'll be singing your opera in the streets with a tin cup in your hand!""          Alfalfa brushes off Spanky's warnings and falls asleep backstage, dreaming that the twenty years have elapsed and the public is awaiting his debut at Barnaby's opera house. However, Alfalfa is quickly booed by the audience and pelted with rotten vegetables. An angry Barnaby, now a wizened old man, throws Alfalfa out into the New York streets and forces him to sing for pennies in the snow. Hungry and broke, Alfalfa and Porky happen upon ""Club Spanky"", an ornate nightclub on Broadway, owned by a now-rich Spanky and headlined by the also rich Darla and ""Cab Buckwheat"".          Inviting them in to see the show, Spanky offers to let Alfalfa and Porky work for him again. Porky immediately accepts, but Alfalfa stubbornly refuses. However, after seeing the floor show starring Darla, Buckwheat, Porky, and a few other performers, Alfalfa is won over and changes his mind. Just as he begins to sing, however, Barnaby appears to drag him back out by the arm to sing in the snow. Alfalfa struggles to release himself from Barnaby's grip while the children chant ""We want Alfalfa!""          At this point, Alfalfa awakens to find himself back in Spanky's cellar with the audience continuing to chant in the background. Spanky begs him to join in the last act, and Alfalfa, needing no further convincing, tears up his contract and rushes onstage to sing Bing Crosby's ""Learn to Croon"" for the show's finale.

In addition, ""Follies of 1938"", particularly its extended dream sequence, features lavish production design and filmmaking typical of feature length MGM musicals. MGM in fact helped finance the short beyond its usual contributions to the Roach shorts; as a result its opening titles read ""Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents ""Our Gang Follies of 1938"", A Hal Roach Production,"" as opposed to the usual ""Hal Roach Presents ""Our Gang"" in..."" At a negative cost of $58 thousand, ""Follies of 1938"" was the most expensive ""Our Gang"" short ever produced.          The short's cast includes over one hundred children, as nearly all of the parts in the film (even the ""adults"" in Alfalfa's dream sequence) are played by kids. The lone exceptions are Henry Brandon's ""Barnaby"" character (not named onscreen, but named as such in the script), and the other three adults seen at the Cosmopolitan Opera House. Brandon's villainous Barnaby character was re-purposed from another Hal Roach production, Laurel and Hardy's 1934 feature ""Babes in Toyland"". One of the featured singers in Spanky's cellar show is Annabelle Logan, a girl who sings a swing rendition of the traditional Scottish song ""The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond"". Logan would grow up to become Annie Ross, a successful jazz singer and actress.          ""Our Gang Follies of 1938"" is one of four sound ""Our Gang"" shorts that fell into the public domain after the copyright lapsed in the 1960s (the other three being ""School's Out"", ""Bear Shooters"", and ""Waldo's Last Stand"").

49619133,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49619133,Bliss (1997 film),"Bliss is a 1997 American erotic drama film written and directed by Lance Young, in his film debut. It stars Sheryl Lee, Craig Sheffer and Terence Stamp. The film also features Lance Young's sister, Leigh Taylor-Young, as well as Molly Parker.          It was screened during the opening of the San Francisco International Film Festival.          The film revolves around a young married couple who are trying to address issues impacting their sex life.          Media attention on the film was limited yet divided among the critics.          Maria (Sheryl Lee) and Joseph (Craig Sheffer) are a young couple, married for only six months, but already facing issues that prevent them from enjoying a fulfilling sex life. In their attempt to address and resolve the issue, they reach out to marriage counsellor Alfred (Spalding Gray). During the process, Joseph is shocked to find out that Maria has never had a genuine orgasm when they made love to each other. Meanwhile, Maria, who is not happy with the results of Alfred's traditional psychoanalytic approach, reaches out to Baltazar (Terence Stamp).          Joseph works as an architect at a construction site. One day, while at work, Joseph's site colleagues invite him to spy on an old man who's having sex with The Redhead. It is only when he decides to look through the telescope lens that he finds out that one of the women is Maria. The old man is Baltazar, an alternative sex therapist who engages in sex with his patients as part of his technique. Joseph, furious, confronts Balthazar about him and his wife, but in a turn of events he becomes a patient himself.          During one of his attempts to practice the techniques taught by Baltazar, Joseph causes Maria to suffer a seizure, which results in her hospitalization. At that time it is revealed that her sex life dysfunction is linked to the incestuous sexual abuse that she suffered as a child, perpetrated by her father. She is now called to confront the memories of the past, in order to recover.          Sheryl Lee researched into psychology and attended a tantric sex workshop, in preparation for the role of Maria. Craig Sheffer was hired to be the main character in this movie after Leigh Taylor-Young recommended him to her brother Lance Young. Both Leigh and Craig worked together in the Hamptons TV Series.          The score for the film was written by Polish composer Jan A.P.Kaczmarek (winner of the 2005 Academy Award for Best Original Score "" for ""Finding Neverland"")."" The soundtrack is furnished with classical orchestra cues, primarily accompanied by piano or violin, and occasionally features a soprano.          The film received mixed reviews by the critics in both mainstream media as well as smaller publications. Sheffer and Lee's performances were harshly criticized by ""New York Times"" critic, Stephen Holden, who mentioned that ""If the cast deserves at least half a gold star for pretending to take this stuff seriously, neither Mr. Sheffer nor Ms. Lee are able to make their yuppie characters likable"". Richard von Busack was of similar opinion regarding Lee's acting, noting that ""Almost useless as either erotica or therapy, Bliss squanders Lee. As good as she is as a vengeful girl, she's still awfully soppy as a weeper."" At the same time both Lee and Sheffer were praised as extraordinarily layered, powerful, physical and fearless, by Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid. Terence Stamp was unanimously considered to be predictably good and well-suited in the run-of-the-mill role of the therapist. Moving away from the quality of the acting itself, Kevin Thomas of ""Los Angeles Times"" felt the film fails primarily due to Young's writing and direction. He highlights that information about Maria's character is mentioned by the other leading characters instead of the viewer discovering it through the film's plot. Another point Thomas raises is the fact that there is considerable imbalance on the level of graphic depiction of sex scenes based on gender participation. Even though the film has extensive sex scenes involving a female character (Maria) and a male character (Joseph), he points out that it becomes conservative when it comes to equivalent scenes between two male characters (Joseph and Baltazar). What the critics agreed on, across the board, is that the film has a plethora of erotic scenes. So much so that it can be mistaken for educational or academic manual about sex. Despite the varying opinions on the quality of the film overall, it was generally acknowledged by the critics that the topic addressed in the film is very important.          The film screened on the weekend of June 6–8 in the United States, making $54,547 in that first weekend of its release. Ultimately, it grossed $294,064.          Significant controversy arose regarding the film’s rating, due to the extensive erotic scenes, strong sex related dialogue as well as the rather novel (at the time) topic it negotiates. As a result, it was initially assigned an NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America which was heavily contested by Young. After a lengthy process of numerous re-submissions to the MPAA and arguing his case in front of a special appeals board, the film was eventually released with an R rating in the American theaters.

Sullivan was born in Boston and trained in the office of Edmund M. Wheelwright, Boston City Architect (1891-1894). Sullivan succeeded Wheelwright as City Architect and served in that position from 1895 to 1901, when he became a junior partner in the firm of Maginnis, Walsh and Sullivan. This firm was widely known for its ecclesiastical work. He withdrew from that partnership to carry on work independently in 1906.

7499118,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7499118,Eastern Suburbs RUFC (Canberra),"The Eastern Suburbs Rugby Union Club Canberra, based out of Griffith, Australian Capital Territory, was founded in 1938.          Easts compete in the John I Dent Cup, the highest level rugby competition in the region.          'Easties' as they are affectionately known by their club members, has a rich and proud history. The club is responsible for producing some of Australia's most talented and respected rugby players. Easts are one of A.C.T rugby's foundation clubs, and were an integral part of the developmental process that has seen Canberra become known worldwide as one of the most influential and respected rugby playing cities.          Easts were once affiliated with the RMC Duntroon Rugby Club. RMC provided Easts with a plethora of rugby talent, and this dramatically increased the capacity of Easts to turn out competitive sides on a weekly basis. In the mid 80s the RMC rugby fraternity split from the Easts to establish itself as an independent entity. RMC now compete in the ACT Division 1 competition.          The club survived tumultuous years in the early 2000s, which saw the clubhouse in Manuka sold. Whilst Easts played regular finals football in these years, the financial stability and ongoing future of the club was in jeopardy.          Easts has survived in large part due to the diligent work undertaken under the former President, Mr Owen Brown in the years following the sale of the clubhouse, as well as many other dedicated club men and ladies.          2008 was a great year for Easts who made the grand final on the back of a strong playing roster and great depth in the clubs ranks. Easts narrowly lost to the Queanbeyan Whites 22-15 in an exciting match in front of a large crowd at Viking Park.          The period following the strong 2008 season has been dark for Easts, with 2009 to 2012 seeing the club struggle on the field, however a slew of new initiatives should see Easts again challenging for the John I Dent Cup in 2013.          2012 saw Brumbies head coach, Jake White (Springboks RWC winning coach) undertake an initiative to bolster the local ACT competition. This saw the introduction of five ACT Brumbies players allocated to Easts, including: Stephen Moore (Brumbies/Wallabies - Hooker), Jerry Yanuyanutawa (Fiji, Brumbies, London-Irish - Prop), Ben Hand (Brumbies, Grenoble RFC - Lock), Michael Hooper (Australian U20's, Wallabies, Brumbies, Waratahs - Flanker) and Andrew Smith(Brumbies -Fullback/Centres). Should these players not be named in the match 22 for the Brumbies in the Super 15 Competition, they will play for Easts.          This system is set to continue, with new Brumbies contracted players being allocated to local Premier Division clubs, with David Pocock, Clyde Rathbone, Jordan Smiler, Etienne Ooshuizen, Stephan Van der Walt and Ruan Smith joining Easts. Previous players associated with Easts, Stephen Moore and Andrew Smith are also amongst this group, who if not selected in the Brumbies match day side, will represent Easts in the John I Dent Cup.           These professional players are also available for coaching and mentoring of Easts players and academy members, further strengthening the links with the local community as well as providing invaluable advice to Easts players.          2012 saw a change in presidency with Mr Arch Vanderglas taking on the role, and was re-elected to the presidency for 2013, alongside many changes to the Easts board and coaching ranks. This has invigorated the club, with many new and old faces alike joining the club for the 2013 season.          2013 will also see Easts celebrate their 75th anniversary. This coincides with the ACT's centenary celebrations, highlighting the strong history and ties the club has with the Canberra community, especially in the venerable old suburbs in the inner south, in which much of Canberra's early history revolved.          Easts currently participate in the ACTRU Premier Division based in Canberra. Easts have not secured a premiership title since 1947, with the club coming close in 2008, runners up to the Queanbeyan Whites.","['Rugby union teams in the Australian Capital Territory', 'Rugby clubs established in 1938', '1938 establishments in Australia']"
19306820,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19306820,Sanctuary of Minerva,"The Sanctuary of Minerva is a temple of the Roman era, situated at Breno, in locality ""Spinera"". It rises to a rocky outcrop on the banks of the river Oglio, faced with a natural cave within which flowed a spring.          The site was already a place of worship since the Iron Age and had a shrine (which were found a few yards of stone and a brandopferplatz) that is a paved area that housed the burning rituals. Following the Romanization of the camunian territory, on the former sanctuary was built, in the early first century, a Roman temple dedicated to the goddess Minerva.          The Roman final structure, built next to the indigenous, consisted of a row of rooms assigned to the rock and the sides by two wings that porticoed heading for the river delimiting the courtyard of the temple. The main hall housed in an elevated niche, the statue of Minerva, Roman copy of a Greek statue of the fifth century BC          In the fourth century started the process of Christianization of Valle Camonica that imposed the end of the cult of Minerva. Into the fifth century the sanctuary was destroyed by a violent fire, and the statue of Minerva was beheaded with force.          Later, during the thirteenth century, a flood of the Oglio river covered the area in debris and the site was finally abandoned.          The existence of the temple was largely forgotten with time following the Christianization of Valcamonica, although some collective memory of the temple survived among locals, with a nearby bridge being referred to as ""ponte di Minerva"" (the bridge of Minerva) and a nearby church, although dedicated to Virgin Mary, being colloquially referred to by locals as ""The Church of Minerva."" However, the temple's existence and the roots of the local nicknames for the nearby bridge and church were officially forgotten. The temple was rediscovered by chance in 1986 during an excavation for the laying of pipes.          Starting in 2004, it was the subject of a restoration which, together with the laying of coverage and implementation of information pathways, have turned into a museum that was opened to the public on 29 September, 2007. In particular, for illustrative purposes, there was placed a copy of the statue of Minerva Hygeia, whose original is exhibited at the National Museum of Valcamonica of Cividate Camuno.","['Museums in Lombardy', 'Museums of Ancient Rome in Italy', 'Archaeological museums in Italy', 'Religious sanctuaries in Italy', 'Ancient Roman temples']"
24455791,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24455791,Synthetic morphology,"Synthetic morphology is a sub-discipline of the broader field of synthetic biology.          In standard synthetic biology, artificial gene networks are introduced into cells, inputs (e.g. chemicals, light) are applied to those networks, and the networks perform logical operations on them and output the result of the operation as the activity of an enzyme or as the amount of green fluorescent protein. Using this approach, synthetic biologists have demonstrated the ability of their gene networks to perform Boolean computation, to hold a memory, and to generate pulses and oscillation.           Synthetic morphology extends this idea by adding output modules that alter the shape or social behaviour of cells in response to the state of the artificial gene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a gene network may switch on an adhesion molecule so that cells stick to each other, or activate a motility system so that cells move. It has been argued that the formation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of about ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion, differential adhesion, cell de-adhesion, cell fusion, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging). Broadly similar lists exist for tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of output modules might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-designed arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'.           The term synthetic morphology was introduced to the peer reviewed scientific literature in 2008 and is now becoming more widely used both in peer-reviewed literature and texts.","['Morphology (biology)', 'Synthetic biology']"

Sri Lankan axis deer are active primarily during early morning and again during the evening, but they are commonly observed near waterholes anytime. The Sri Lankan axis deer eats primarily grasses, but it also eats fallen fruits and leaves. The Sri Lankan axis deer graze closely with langur, peacock, wild buffalo, and sambar deer. They usually lives in groups of between 10-60 animals, though herds may include up to 100 animals.          Axis deer are important prey for the Sri Lankan leopard. It is also prey for sloth bears and jackals.          These deer inhabit lowland dry forests, savannas, and shrub lands.           Very rarely, these deer inhabit dry mountain areas.          Unlike the mainland axis deer (""Axis axis"") which is plentiful, Sri Lankan axis deer populations          are considered to be vulnerable. Threats include hunting for meat and deforestation. Historically, axis deer were found in very large numbers in the entire dry zone of Sri Lanka, but these numbers have been significantly reduced. Today several thousands of these deer are found in Sri Lanka.

The group was a satirical reaction to a bill granting the early payment of bonuses to World War I veterans as articulated in their manifesto:          The manifesto spread nationwide as wire services quickly picked up the group's press releases. Representative Claude Fuller of Arkansas unwittingly increased the group's visibility by denouncing them on the floor of the House. Soon local chapters began popping up at campuses throughout the nation. Enthusiastic new members from as far away as North Dakota paid dues to the main chapter in Princeton and adopted the organization's salute: arm held out towards Washington with ""hand outstretched, palm up and expectant"" – a mockery both of the World War I veterans, whom the founding Princetonians viewed as freeloaders, and of the fascist salute then gaining currency in Europe.          The message of the organization had a rare appeal to both conservatives and liberals. Conservatives saw them as kindred spirits in the effort to keep Roosevelt from spending the country into bankruptcy. Pacifist liberals on the other hand, saw the movement as an opportunity to satirize war itself. Many veterans, however, were disgusted with the movement and felt it was in poor taste.          By June 1936, the Veterans of Future Wars reached its peak membership of 50,000 paid members at 584 college campuses. By the next school year, national attention focused on the Presidential campaign. The group ceased operations in April 1937.          Ironically, the group's joke had become serious prophecy. With the exception of one man who had been injured in an automobile accident, each of the Princetonian founders of the Veterans of Future Wars served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II.","['Advocacy groups', 'Culture jamming', 'Pranksters', 'Princeton University', '1936 in American politics', 'Student organizations in the United States', 'Student organizations established in 1936']"

The name derives from the common practice of colouring the territory of the British Empire red or pink on political maps.          Initially the term was used to apply only to steamship routes (as these were the only practical way of carrying communications between Great Britain and the rest of the Empire), particularly to India via the Suez Canal—a route sometimes referred to as the British Imperial Lifeline. Rail transport was used across France and Italy to the Mediterranean. From 1868 to 1871 the Mont Cenis Pass Railway, a temporary mountain railway line over the Mont Cenis Pass was used for mail.          After use of steamships became widespread at sea, strategically placed coaling stations were acquired to guarantee the mobility of both civil and naval fleets.          In the 1880s the term ""All-Red Route"" was expanded to include the telegraph network (see All Red Line) that connected various parts of the Empire, and by the 1920s it was also being used in reference to proposed air routes, initially airship and then flying boat, between Great Britain and the rest of the Empire, see Imperial Airship Scheme.          The Suez Canal route dramatically shortened the sea path between Britain and its colonies in Asia, and, conscious of its significance, the British sent troops to seize control of the canal in 1882 at the beginning of the British occupation of Egypt; even after British troops were withdrawn from the rest of Egypt in accordance with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, Britain continued to control the canal and kept troops stationed in the canal zone. After Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the canal in 1956, sparking the Suez Crisis, UK Prime Minister Anthony Eden declared that ""The Egyptian has his thumb on our windpipe"", describing the Suez as the ""great imperial lifeline"".          The major ""All-Red Route"" ran as follows:          Southern Britain → Gibraltar → Malta → Alexandria → Port Said (after construction of the Canal) → Suez → Aden → Muscat (and access to the Persian Gulf) → India → Sri Lanka → Burma → Malaya → Singapore (branching out into the Pacific Ocean towards Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, and other British colonies).          With the end of the British Empire and the increasing prevalence of air travel, the terms ""All-Red Route"" and ""British Imperial Lifeline"" have fallen from use, and now exist largely in a historical context, generally in reference to the routes in use during the British Empire.","['British Empire', 'Shipping routes']"

26537047,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26537047,Germanus (patricius),"Germanus, called ""patricius"" (Greek: πατρίκιος), was a leading member of the Byzantine Senate during the reign of Maurice.          Other that a wife called Leontia by Theophanes the Confessor, there is no named relative of Germanus. His name has led to a possible identification with a similarly named son of Germanus (d. 550) and Matasuntha. But said son has also been identified with Germanus, a son-in-law of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia. The common name ""Germanus"" may hint to these figures being related to each other but there is insufficient evidence for identifications.          In November 601 or more likely, in February 602, an unnamed daughter of Germanus married Theodosius, the eldest son of Maurice and Constantina. The marriage was recorded by Theophylact Simocatta, Theophanes the Confessor, the Chronicon Paschale, Joannes Zonaras and Georgios Kedrenos.          On 2 February 602, Theophylact records Germanus rescuing the life of Theodosius from a rioting mob in Constantinople, angry over a food shortage. Later that year, Germanus and Theodosius went hunting to Callicrateia, a brief distance from Constantinople. There they received correspondence from the rebellious army of Thrace. The rebels demanded the deposition of Maurice and offered their support to elevate either Theodosius or Germanus to the throne.          Germanus was soon accused of treason by Maurice. The emperor suspected him of being responsible for the ongoing revolt. Besides the incriminating letter, there was another act pointing to the rebels being allied to Germanus. They were reportedly seizing all horses outside Constantinople, but had left Germanus' horses alone. Germanus pleaded for his innocence in vain. Theodosius convinced his father-in-law to flee before facing the wrath of Maurice.          Germanus and his bodyguard sought sanctuary, first in the church to the Theotokos created by Cyrus of Panopolis, then in the Hagia Sophia. Maurice send his own guards to capture Germanus and turmoil followed. Germanus considered surrendering but a crown sympathetic to him convinced him otherwise. They were convinced that Maurice was intending to execute Germanus.          In late November, 602, Maurice fled Constantinople to escape the advancing rebels. Germanus took his chance to claim the throne. He counted on the support of the Green faction in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. He had miscalculated as the Greens firmly rejected him. The would-be-emperor immediately turned to support Phocas, the leader of the rebels. According to Theophylact, Phocas had briefly considered elevating Germanus to the throne, but instead seized the throne for himself.          A rumor of the time suggested that Germanus had managed to save the life of Theodosius by bribing Phocas' men. Theophylact dismisses any truth to the rumor. In any case, Phocas did not trust Germanus. The Chronicon mentions Germanus becoming a priest in 603. Theophanes considers this to be a direct decision by Phocas, who had discovered Germanus conspiring against him.          If Phocas believed that he was finished with Germanus, he was wrong. Theophanes records that Constantina maintained contact with Germanus and that both were conspiring against Phocas. Their messages were entrusted to Petronia, a maidservant under Constantina. Petronia proved disloyal and reported the conspiracy to Phocas. Constantina was arrested and placed in the custody of Theopemptus, prefect of Constantinople. Her interrogation included torture and she was forced to give the name of her fellow conspirators.          Constantina and all three of her daughters were executed at Chalcedon. Germanus and his unnamed daughter were also executed on the island of Prote. The daughter had been the widow of Theodosius. Theophanes places the deaths in 605/606 but the exact date is in doubt. The Chronicon Paschale reports that all six were decapitated.","['600s deaths', 'Justinian dynasty', '7th-century Byzantine people', 'Executed Byzantine people', 'People executed by decapitation', 'Year of birth unknown', '7th-century executions']"

1556834,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1556834,Miquelet lock,"Miquelet lock is a modern term used by collectors and curators, largely in the English-speaking world, for a type of firing mechanism used in muskets and pistols. It is a distinctive form of snaplock, originally as a flint-against-steel ignition form, once prevalent in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Balkans, North Africa, the Ottoman Empire and throughout Spain's colonies from the late 16th to the mid 19th centuries.           The term ""miquelet lock"" was not recorded until the 19th century, long after the appearance of the mechanism in the 16th century, and is of uncertain origin. One commonly held view is that it was coined by British troops in the Peninsular War to describe the style of musket used by the Miquelet (militia) that had been assigned to the Peninsular Army of the Duke of Wellington. In most of Spain, it was traditionally called the ""llave de rastrillo"", and in Catalonia and Valencia it was called the ""llave de pedreñal"" or simply ""pedreñal"".          There is often confusion, or at least a difference of opinion, as to what constitutes a snaplock, snaphaunce, miquelet and a flintlock. The term flintlock was, and still is, often applied to any form of friction (flint) lock other than the wheellock with the various forms sub-categorized as snaphaunce, miquelet, English Doglock, Baltic Lock, and French or ""true"" flintlock (""true"" being the final, widely used form). Strictly speaking, all are flintlocks. However, current usage demands the separation of all other forms of flintlock from the so-called ""true flintock"".           After the disastrous campaign of Algiers (1541) where ""wind and rain"" prevented the firing of arquebuses, Charles I of Spain might have expressed to his gunmakers the urgent need to devise an ignition mechanism less prone to failure in bad weather. Problems were caused on both wheellocks and matchlocks, firstly by wind blowing away the gunpowder when the pan cover was opened during priming, and secondly, by rain wetting matches and gunpowder. In less than three decades, a lock did appear that is known today as the miquelet lock.          The poet/novelist Ginés Pérez de Hita, in his historical novel ""Civil Wars of Granada"", alludes to his ""escopeta de rastrillo"" being in common use in Xàtiva and Valencia prior to 1567 (revolt start) and during the Alpujarras Rebellion that ended in 1571.          Cervantes says in the ""Don Quixot"" (in 1604) that in Catalonia their name was pedreñal, to the extent that pedreñal lock means miquelet lock, the long-barreled wheel lock pistols were not called pedreñals.          As both de Hita and Cervantes allude to pistols, pedrenales, and escopetas being in use that were not wheellocks, it is reasonable to suggest some form of flint-against-steel gunlock was in use by the late 16th century. Indeed, from about 1580 on, the listings in estate auctions increasingly referred to ""arcabuces de rastrillo"" and ""escopeta de rastrillo."" ""Rastrillar,"" to comb or rake, perfectly describes the action of a flint down a battery (frizzen) face. Some listings used the term ""llaves de chispa"" (meaning spark locks, applied to all manner of flintlocks, miquelets included). Contemporaries did not use the term ""miquelet"" to describe any type of lock or firearm.           Probably the oldest surviving example of what certainly qualifies as a patilla miquelet lock is item No.I.20 in the Real Armería, Madrid. That unique item is a combination lance and double-barreled gun; its origin unknown, dated almost certainly before 1600.           The archaic form of Spanish lock was further developed by Madrid and provincial gunmakers, almost certainly including the Marquart family of Royal gunmakers, into the Spanish patilla style now most associated with the miquelet.           The miquelet lock, with its combined battery and pan cover was the final innovative link that made the ""true"" flintlock mechanism possible. It proved to be both the precursor and companion to the ""true"" flintlock.           Two main forms of the miquelet were produced: The Spanish lock, where the mainspring pushed up on the heel of the cock foot and the two sears engaged the toe of the cock foot, the other main form was the Italian type (romanlock), where the mainspring pushed down on the toe of the cock foot and the sears engaged the cock on the heel of the foot. Neither form was confined exclusively to either country, that is, both romanlocks of Spanish manufacture and Spanish locks of Italian manufacture are not uncommon.           The features most associated with the miquelet are the horizontal sears, acting through the lockplate, coupled with the external mainspring and the top jaw screw ring. Experts agree that the use of horizontally acting sears is the true defining feature because some variations of the miquelet do not have the external mainspring and/or the large top jaw screw ring.           Another seemingly ubiquitous feature of the Spanish miquelets was the striated battery face, or put another way, vertically grooved frizzen. Initially, the striated face was a detachable plate dovetailed and often screwed to the battery. This allowed for the replacement of worn faces without having to rework or replace the complete battery. The detachable grooved face went out of fashion around 1660-1675, replaced by grooving made directly into the battery face, almost certainly due to improved heat treatment and tempering of the battery. The grooving was to a great extent eliminated by French-influenced Madrid gunsmiths around 1700. However, the practice of using both the detachable and integral grooved face was continued by many Spanish provincial gunsmiths as well as by North African and Ottoman lockmakers.           The fully developed lock was known by various names, depending on region or variation of design. In Spain, it was known as the ""llave española""; or simply the ""patilla"". The patilla is the classic Spanish miquelet and the designation of patilla is often used nowadays in lieu of miquelet. The term patilla derives from the fact that the front foot of the cock resembled a rooster foot. In Catalonia, it was ""clau de miquelet."" In Portugal, it was known as the ""fecho de patilha de invenção.""           Indigenous variations of the patilla had names such as the ""a la de invenciõn"", later known as the ""alla romana"" or ""romanlock"" or simply, the ""Italian."" The Spanish miquelet is termed ""alla micheletta"" by Italian auctioneers. Serious writers and collectors in Europe eschew this term and use more precise, chronologically and geographically pertinent terminology, such as ""alla brobana"" for the Neapolitan (Naples) variety of external-mainspring lock due to its association with the Bourbons and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.           The French influence on the Spanish lock coincided with the accession of the Bourbon Felipe V in 1701 as king of Spain. This influence produced a type of lock known as the ""llave a la moda"" or more commonly as the ""Madrid"" lock as it was produced almost exclusively in and for that city. The Madrid lock is almost indistinguishable from the ordinary French flintlock, with the laterally-operating sears being the only Spanish connection to the classic patilla lock. The half-cock sear (usually round) engaged the top of a small projection often disguised as a rococo embellishment on the breast of the cock. A similar projection on the opposite side of the cock engaged the underside of the full-cock sear, which could be round, flat, or square.          The French flintlock without any miquelet features was termed ""llave a la francesa."" It was used very little on weapons for private use, but was adopted under Carlos IV for use on military arms such as the Spanish Model 1752/1757 musket, although the French lock was later superseded by a miquelet patilla lock on the Model 1752/91 as the French style lock was deemed too fragile, a frequent complaint from colonial authorities.          Locks using features from Spain, France and Italy, which retained the patilla external mainspring and lateral sear setup, came to be labeled ""a las tres modas"" (lock of three fashions). Without a doubt, this lock is the final development of the miquelet flintlock before the percussion era. It was produced in Spain and Italy.           The ""agujeta"" lock or ""la llave de transición"", a contemporary of the patilla, was produced in Ripoll, a gun-making center in Catalonia. The lock was primarily fitted to a long-barreled pistol called a ""pedrenyal"" and also on long guns for a short period until the patilla became the predominant lock of manufacture in Spain. In Italy, the romanlock seems to have been the mechanical counterpart, and possibly the predecessor of the agujeta. The agujeta used a back catch on the cock in lieu of a half cock sear and the mainspring bore down on the toe of the cock as with the romanlock. A detached combination lock, wheellock and what is certainly an agujeta/romanlock form lock, in the Royal Artillery Museum, Turin, strongly suggests the agujeta/romanlock came to Spain from Italy, probably during a period of Spanish involvement there.           The agujeta lock became firmly established early on in North Africa, most likely being crafted in imitation of Spanish imports. One example would be the Kabyle Musket (moukhala or moukalla), sometimes referred to as the Arab toe-lock.           The miquelet is often termed the ""Mediterranean"" lock due to its widespread use in areas surrounding the Mediterranean, particularly in the Ottoman sphere of influence. As one author comments: ""It was to Arabia and Tartary and from there to Russia that the new Spanish lock found its way.""           The miquelet may have come to the attention of arms makers in Istanbul via long-established trade routes from Italian city-states through the port of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) to provinces on the Balkan Peninsula. Other avenues were probably provided by booty from corsair raids and/or from the many Ottoman-Euro conflicts of the period.           The gunmakers of the Ottoman Empire adopted the conventional Spanish patilla in its basic form, albeit with an additional feature in the form of a fastening bridge between the cock screw and the frizzen screw. This bridge or long bridle had the effect of decreasing torsion on the cock axis. It also provided ample space for decoration to suit local traditions.           A percussion cap lock mechanism styled on the patilla and romanlock pattern miquelets was used on pistols and sporting guns right up to the advent of the cartridge firearm. Sculpturing of the hammer in the form of wildlife (lions, dogs, mythical beasts, or fish) was a common practice on these percussion miquelet locks. Miquelets fashioned in this way were particularly well represented by the gunmakers of Eibar.","['Firearm actions', 'Early firearms', 'Spanish inventions']"

He later returned to the states and taught anthropology at Yale University before he became a research associate at the new Institute of Human Relations. With Neal E. Miller, a fellow researcher at the Institute of Human Relations, Dollard also served as a consultant to the Morale Services Division of the U.S. Department of War. He continued to teach at Yale though and later became a professor of psychology in 1952. Dollard retired from Yale in 1969, becoming professor emeritus, until his death in 1980 in New Haven, Connecticut.          Dollard's personal research was focused on the sociological issues of race relations and social class, as well as exploring biographical analyses, suggesting what should be included in biographical materials to permit sound psychological studies, researching various topics related to sociology and culture, and psychoanalysis. According to his research, much can be predicted without knowing anything about the individual by simply having knowledge of the culture into which the person is born. He realized that sociological variables, such as social class and culture, influence a person's particular learning experiences. Unlike most psychoanalysts at the time, Dollard recognized the importance of considering actual human social conditions rather than just abstract psychological principles constructed in a laboratory setting. These ideas and practices led him to write one of his most influential works, ""Caste and Class in a Southern Town"", the now classic sociological study of race relations in the Deep South. From 1941 to 1945 he also studied fear and morale in modern warfare, which culminated in several reports, including ""Fear and Courage under Battle Conditions"" (1943) and ""Fear in Battle"" (""The Infantry Journal"", 1944).          However, Dollard is likely best known within the psychological community as a member of the distinguished group of young researchers (among whom was Neal E. Miller) at Yale University in the 1930s who, inspired initially by Clark L. Hull, sought to combine learning theory and psychoanalysis. The groups' first major publication was ""Frustration and Aggression"", and has become a classic which is still widely cited in introductory texts. It outlined a view, now referred to as the frustration-aggression hypothesis, which formed the basis for later developments such as Leonard Berkowitz's ""Aggression: A Social Psychological Analysis"" (1962) and the animal research on frustration and aggression in the 1960s and 1970s, which caused a controversy between the researchers and animal rights groups. Miller sums up Dollard's contributions to the group as such: ""If trying to bring together contributions from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and psychotherapy no longer seems so novel, it is because Dollard and other pioneers had the courage and tenacity to break through traditional barriers"".","['1900 births', '1980 deaths', 'American psychologists', 'American social scientists', 'Yale University faculty', 'People from Menasha, Wisconsin', 'University of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x93Madison alumni', '20th-century physicians']"
12309,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12309,Goran Bregović,"Goran Bregović (, , born 22 March 1950) is a Yugoslav musician and one of the most internationally known modern musicians and composers of the Balkans. He left Bosnia and Herzegovina before the Bosnian War. Recently, he announced his official return to Sarajevo and set up a Roma education foundation.          Bregović has composed for such varied artists as Iggy Pop and Cesária Évora. He rose to fame playing guitar with his rock band Bijelo Dugme. Among his better known scores are three of Emir Kusturica's films (""Time of the Gypsies"", ""Arizona Dream"", and ""Underground"").          Bregović's compositions, extending Balkan musical inspirations to innovative extremes, draw upon European classicism and Balkan rhythms.          Bregović's music carries Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Romani, Romanian, Serbian and Turkish themes and is a fusion of popular music with traditional polyphonic music from the Balkans, tango, and brass bands.          Born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia to a Croat father Franjo Bregović and Serb mother Borka Perišić, Goran grew up with an older sister Dajana and a younger brother Predrag. Their father was from Croatian Zagorje, specifically Sveti Petar Čvrstec village near Križevci, while their mother was born in Virovitica to parents that shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of Čemernica, settling there from the village of Kazanci near Gacko in eastern Herzegovina. Her father, Goran's maternal grandfather, fought in the Serbian Army at the Thessaloniki Front during World War I and as a reward received land in Slavonia where he soon moved his family.          Goran's parents met shortly after the end of World War II in Virovitica where his mother Borka lived and his father Franjo (who fought on the Partisan side during the war) attended a Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) military school. Franjo Bregović soon got his first job, teaching ballistics at a Sarajevo military school, so the family (which at the time only had a daughter) moved there. Goran, their second child, was born in 1950.          Goran was 10 years old when his parents divorced. In later interviews he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of his parents' marriage. Soon after the split, his father moved to Livno, taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno. Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.          Goran played violin in a music school. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregović wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long. Upon entering high school, Goran joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior - he crashed into a school-owned Mercedes-Benz). Bregović then entered grammar school and its school band Beštije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing folk music in a kafana in Konjic, working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.          Spotting him at a Beštije gig in 1969, Željko Bebek invited 18-year-old Bregović to play bass guitar in his band Kodeksi, which Goran gladly accepted.          Eventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregović moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregović, Željko Bebek, Zoran Redžić and Milić Vukašinović. All of them would eventually become members of Bijelo Dugme at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in departure of Željko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in Naples and took them back to Sarajevo.          Then, in the autumn of 1971, Goran enrolled at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, Milić Vukašinović left for London, so Bregović formed a band with Nuno Arnautalić called Jutro (Morning), which Redžić soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to Bijelo Dugme (""White Button"").          From 1974 until 1989, Bregović played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind Bijelo Dugme (""White Button""). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in SFR Yugoslavia.          At the time Bijelo Dugme was falling apart, Goran entered the world of film music. His first project was Emir Kusturica's ""Time of the Gypsies"" (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by Iggy Pop) for Emir's next film ""Arizona Dream"" (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for Patrice Chéreau's ""Queen Margot"" was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. The next year's Golden Palm award           went to ""Underground"", for which Goran Bregović composed the music.          In 1997, he worked with Turkish singer Sezen Aksu on her album ""Düğün ve Cenaze"" (""Wedding and Funeral""). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.          He made an album with George Dalaras in 1999 named ""Thessaloniki – Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes"". In the same year, Bregović recorded an album called ""Kayah i Bregović"" (Kayah and Bregović) with popular Polish singer Kayah which sold over 700,000 copies in Poland (seven times platinum record).          In 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, Krzysztof Krawczyk, titled ""Daj mi drugie życie"" (""Give Me Second Life"").          In 2005, Bregović took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.          A number of works created by Bregović can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film , most notably ""Đurđevdan."" The film itself actually features more Bregović samples than the soundtrack. Two musical numbers by Bregović, ""Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,"" and ""Gas, Gas"" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian ""novela"", Salve Jorge, on the television network Rede Globo.          Bregović performs with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from Belgrade, women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and Roma singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.          Since 1998, Bregović has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Weddings and Funerals Orchestra. This consists of 10 people (in the small version) or 37 (in the large version, although, in some instances, this number varies, depending on participants from the host country).          The small orchestra consists of Alen Ademović (vocals, drums), Bokan Stanković (first trumpet), Dalibor Lukić (second trumpet), Stojan Dimov (sax, clarinet), Aleksandar Rajković (first trombone, glockenspiel), Miloš Mihajlović (second trombone), Dejan Manigodić (tuba) and Goran himself. The uniqueness of the orchestra comes from the exceptional voice of solo singer Vaska Jankovska (Macedonian Roma girl) and backup Bulgarian singers Daniela Radkova-Aleksandrova, and Ludmila Radkova-Traikova. The large orchestra usually has singers from the Belgrade Orthodox male choir, string performers from Poland, or from the country in which they perform, as well as other local performers.          In 2013, as part of his Asia-Pacific tour (including Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong), Bregović performed with a string quartet, a male choir, Bulgarian singers and half of a brass band. The other part of the brass band - including bass and percussions - were being played from his computer.          During the Eurovision 2008 final in Belgrade Arena, Serbia, he had a small concert.          He also composed the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010; 'Ovo Je Balkan' sung by Milan Stanković.          In 1993, Bregović married his long-time girlfriend Dženana Sudžuka. The wedding ceremony held in Paris featured film director Emir Kusturica as the groom's best man and longtime Bijelo Dugme backing vocal, Amila Sulejmanović as the bride's maid of honour.          The couple has three daughters: Ema (born in March 1995), Una (February 2002), and Lulu (May 2004).          Bregović owns real-estate properties all over the world, but spends most of his time between Belgrade, where most of his musical collaborators reside, and Paris, where his spouse lives with their three daughters.          He also has a daughter named Željka (born out of wedlock from a previous relationship) who gave birth to Goran's grand daughter, Bianca. He has a brother named Predrag who lives in New York City, and a sister, Dajana who lives in Split.          On 12 June 2008, Bregović injured his spine, falling from a tree. He fell four meters from a cherry tree in the garden of his home in Senjak, a Belgrade district, breaking vertebrae. However, according to the doctors, his condition was ""stable without neurological complications."" After surgery, he made a quick recovery and on 8 July and 9 July, he held two big concerts in New York City, where for more than two hours each night, he proved his performance skills had not suffered from the accident.          Bregović prefers to avoid delving into politics. In 2009, he said, ""Yugoslavia is the intersection of so many worlds: Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim. With music, I don't have to represent anyone, except myself -- because I speak the first language of the world, the one everyone understands: music."" In March 2015, Bregović performed in a concert in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia the previous year. The following month, the Life Festival in Oświęcim, Poland cancelled an appearance by Bregović, saying that his statements were ""contrary to the values cherished by the Life Festival founders.""

14162027,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14162027,Panbari Mosque,"The historic Panbari Masjid or Rangamati Masjid is a famous mosque in northeast India and is considered to be the oldest mosque in the Indian state of Assam. The mosque is situated on the National Highway 31, near Panbari and Rangamati, about 25 km east from Dhubri town. This 15th/16th century three-domed mosque also presents an excellent example of great architectural achievements of the Sultanate of Bengal.          The mosque was believed to be built by administrator Alauddin Husain Shah in between 1493 and 1519 AD who was then the sultan of Bengal, though its exact history is not known. After taking over the kingdom of Kamatapur, the sultan declared to commission a mosque in Panbari to celebrate the victory and to offer prayers. Another story says that the mosque was built in 1662 when Mir Jumla, a powerful subedar of Bengal, under the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, invaded Assam. Adjacent to the mosque there is also an ""Idgah"" and a deep well, which were also probably constructed during the same period. The mosque has a vast paved courtyard and one minaret, which were constructed later. About 150 people can pray inside the mosque at a time.          During the reign of the Koch rulers Rangamati area was a very prosperous place. It was the frontier post of the Koch rulers. Invading army of Bengal sultans and Mughals also used Rangamati fort. The area, as some believe, was also the headquarters of Alauddin Husain Shah. And this mosque was used as a prayer hall by the Muslim soldiers.          It is said that about 200 years ago, the local people of this place found this mosque in Panbari ""Pahar"" under the thick foliage. They cleaned this place and started to offer Namaz there. Today, Panbari ""Pahar"" is known as the holy seat and the mosque is a holy shrine for the people of western Assam. The scenic beauty of the hills with its rich flora, its unique location together with the archeological importance, holds promise of becoming an important tourist spot in India. Of late, a township consisting of brick-plinths, terracotta antiquities as also a hoard of coins have been discovered near the mosque, which have been tentatively attributed to the Mughal regime.          The mosque is run by a local body, Panbari mosque management committee, who appoints the imam and other employees. Various religious services like imamat and leading namaz are performed by the imam. The expenses of the mosque are covered from different kind of donations obtained by the mosque. As the mosque enjoy a special place in the society of western Assam, people donate generously irrespective of religion, caste or creed.          During the annual Islamic festivals like Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha, this mosque wears a special look. Thousands of people from different parts of the country visit the mosque. Not only the people from India but also from England and Japan visit this place. Normally hundreads of people gather here for the weekly Friday noon Jumu'ah prayers, besides other regular prayers.          As the mosque is standing on the national highway 31, regular bus services are available from Guwahati, Dhubri and Cooch Behar. The nearest railway station is Fakiragram (30 kilometers) and the nearest airport is the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport (200 kilometers). The mosque is also not far away from the mighty Brahmaputra (8 kilometers).          The Archaeological Survey of India, Ministry of Culture has taken some steps to conserve the monuments of this area. However, local people are not happy with the token steps of the government and demand more.","['Dhubri', 'Mosques in Assam', 'Places of worship in Assam']"
12514317,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12514317,Nookicky,"Nookicky is a Japanese visual kei rock band formed in 2001 by Tomo Furukawa(Full) after the split of previous band, guniw tools. Zull and Dinah joined soon after that and they played various lives, including one in Hong Kong.           Zull left the band in 2003 and joined The Candy Spooky Theater and Monaural Curve and was replaced by U (also in Kharn). Support member Fuumi also joined in 2003 and played with Nookicky for a few months.          After numerous releases and live shows in Japan, Hong Kong, Tibet, Nepal and the US, Dinah left the band in 2005 in order to concentrate on her solo project. She is now in the band Sound Dope. Currently Nookicky consists of Full on vocals and U on guitar. The band is now on hiatus, with U in the band Kharn and Full concentrating on his solo project Shilfee and Tulipcorobockles.          Even though Nookicky is based on the same influences, it is not an extension of Guniw Tools in any way. Dark songs were typical for Nookicky in the beginning, but because the band went through a lot of changes, the style became a little lighter. Inspiration for their music comes from countries like India and Nepal and is very noticeable in their music. Nookicky certainly has a refreshing electro sound based on FULL’s wonderful imagination.          Nookicky was formed in 2001 shortly after Guniw Tools broke up in December 2000. It started out as FULL’s solo project, for which he provided the vocals, but soon enough he formed a team with his friend Dinah, whose official position in the band was ""dancer"", later on he took to playing bass and flute. The name Nookicky comes from the words ‘nook’ (as in corner) and ‘kicky’ which according to FULL means excited.          A few months later the band recruited their guitarist ZULL. It is interesting to know that FULL had only known him for a month before he asked him to join Nookicky. During this initial period they released a few mini-albums; Cloudy Pop Book, Rigid Ink Pool and in 2002, Koochachu.          However soon after releasing their first full album, One Aging by Nook in 2003, ZULL decided to leave the band. Luckily, a replacement U was found during the Spring of 2003. During that time, they were also joined by a support-bassist, fu~mi.          Soon they released the album Pinhole which was followed by Rotepin in 2005. Both clearly had a different sound compared to their previous albums. The sound was lighter and varied more than their earlier music, now supported by a stronger bass and guitar. Influences from Tibet and India are clearly heard on these albums too.          Dinah left the band in the beginning of 2005 to focus on a solo career. Because fu~mi had only been a support-bassist, the band only existed as only a two-person unit of FULL and U after that.          In July 2005, the album Noon Moon was released, which was considered the most ""dreamy"" album Nookicky had released. Unfortunately this was also the last release Nookicky produced before FULL announced that the band would go on hiatus after their tour in December.          The band is still on hiatus while FULL is working on a new project that he founded called Shilfee and Tulipcorobockles, which leans towards the opera/rockabilly sound. U’s been busy with Kahrn. Dinah went through a sex change and is now a woman and currently occupied with Sound Dope. ZULL left Nookicky firstly for Monaural Curve but also joined the band The Candy Spooky Theater.          Even though Nookicky took their chances to perform in foreign countries (Hong Kong, Tibet, Nepal, New York) it is questionable whether they will ever get back together again. Likewise with Guniw Tools, FULL seems to have a thing for putting projects on hiatus and never reviving them again. However, this all should not overshadow the fact that Nookicky presented us some wonderful music to enjoy.

4319116,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4319116,Quartier Général d'Aboville,"Quartier Général d'Aboville, formerly Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, is a French Army artillery base in France. It is located two miles (3 km) southwest of the city of Chaumont, Haute-Marne, just to the west of the Route Nationale 67 (N67) highway about 0.5 miles (1 km) north of Semoutiers-Montsaon in the Haute-Marne département of northeast France. During the early years of the Cold War, Chaumont-Semoutiers air base was used for the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE).          The area around Chaumont has a long history of American military presence. During World War I the Haute-Marne département was one of the bloodiest areas of France with many battles fought on its soil. In 1917, the headquarters of the American Expeditionary Force was located in the city of Chaumont, Haute-Marne. Starting in the mid-1930s, a grass airstrip was used near Chaumont by the French Air Force for training. After the fall of France, the German Luftwaffe also used the facility as a training station. After the war, the airstrip was left unused.          With the outbreak of the Cold War in the late 1940s, with the Berlin Airlift and the ongoing threat from the Soviet Union to Western Europe, negotiations began in November 1950 between NATO and the United States to establish air bases and station combat wings in France to meet European defense needs.          During the negotiations for selection of sites, the World War II airfield at Chaumont was proposed for expansion into a modern air base. The airfield was unused since the war and there were no plans for French civil or military use. An agreement was reached to develop Chaumont into a NATO facility and station United States Air Force tactical fighter-bombers there by 1953.          Construction of Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base started on 25 January 1951, with much effort being made to have minimal facilities ready by November. Various delays, however, pushed runway construction back to October.          The design of the airfield was to space parked aircraft as far apart as possible by the construction of a circular marguerite system of hardstands that could be revetted later with earth for added protection. Typically the marguerite consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands around a large central hangar. Each hardstand held one or two aircraft, and allowed the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. This construction can be seen clearly in the satellite image link at the bottom of this article.          Minimum facilities were ready for USAF use by April 1952. The facilities consisted of 255 tent frames built on concrete floors, and 24 prefabricated wooden buildings with utilities. The entire facility was a work in progress, however, until 1956.          In May 1952, the 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing activated at Chaumont with the 125th, 127th, and 128th Fighter Squadrons flying the Republic F-84G ""Thunderjet"".          The unit was part of the Oklahoma Air National Guard and was called to active duty on 10 October 1950 during the Korean War. When activated, the Wing flew various versions of the F-84, with the 125th FBSquadron flying F-84B's at Will Rogers Airport at Tulsa; the 127th FBS flying F-84Cs at Wichita Municipal Airport in Kansas, and the 128th FBS at Dobbins Air Force Base near Atlanta, Georgia, flying P-47D's (redesignated F-47's).          By 27 November, the wing assembled Alexandria Municipal Airport Louisiana for conversion training in the newer F-84Gs. Deployment of the wing was delayed, however, by the need to transfer pilots to Korea from training and delays in receiving engines for the F-84Gs, as well as the ongoing construction at Chaumont. Training and delays continued throughout 1951. Due to these delays, most of the activated National Guard airmen were released from active duty and never deployed to France.          With mostly regular Air Force personnel and all the delays behind them, the Wing departed Louisiana on 5 May 1952 for Europe, however, the 137th inherited a base that was little more than acres of mud where wheat fields used to be. The only hardened facilities at Chaumont was a concrete runway and a handful of tarpaper shacks. For the first two years of residence at Chaumont, the wing headed up an engineering project that resulted in the construction of permanent barracks, a wing headquarters, flightline shops, and warehouses.          Runway and taxiway preparation, along with final negotiations with the French government to allow nuclear weapon capable F-84's on its soil prevented the aircraft from being deployed to Chaumont, with the 125th and 127th Fighter-Bomber Squadrons being stationed at Ramstein Air Base and the 128th being stationed at Neubiberg Air Base in West Germany until final approval was received. The aircraft arrived at Chaumont on 25 June, being the first USAF tactical air fighters to be based permanently in France, albeit working mostly in tents and temporary wooden buildings on their new base.          At Chaumont, the 137th flew 61 F-84G's, approximately 20 aircraft per squadron. In addition, there were two C-47s, a T-6F, and three T-33A support aircraft.          During the summer, pilots of the 137th deployed to Wheelus Air Base, Libya, to obtain air-to-air and air-to-ground bombing and gunnery proficiency.          On 10 July 1952, the 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing activated and took over the mission from the 137 FBW. The 48th, with three fighter squadrons, the 492d, 493d, and 494th gained the personnel and equipment of the 137th. The 137 FBW was reassigned without personnel and equipment, back to the control of Oklahoma Air National Guard. The 58 F-84Gs and support aircraft were assigned to the 48th. The few National Guardsmen still with the wing departed and the last were released from active duty on 9 July, although a few reserve officers remained on active duty for an additional six to twelve months.          With the F-84, the 48 FBW supported NATO and the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), activities, participating in exercises with the US Seventh Army. In addition, the 48th conducted operational readiness exercises and tactical evaluations. Honing bombing and gunnery skills. The 48th frequently deployed to Wheelus AFB, Libya for training.          The 48th developed into the premier fighter wing in France, serving the longest, from 10 July 1952 through 15 January 1960. The men and women of the 48th worked hard to develop Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base into one of the best air bases in Europe. Its squadrons remained unchanged while flying three different type of fighters, the F-84G, F-86F and the F-100D, and maintaining the capability to fight either a conventional or nuclear war if need be.          An open house was held once a year, with great numbers of French civilians in attendance. In 1954, over 15,000 attended the Armed Forces Day event to see static aircraft displays, watch flight demonstrations, listen to a French army band and other activities. In just over three years since construction began, Chaumont Air Base became an important part of the Haute-Marne region.          To bolster Franco-American relations, the 48th Wing Staff came up with the idea of changing the wing insignia. Chaumont AB is located not far from the workshops of Frédéric Bartholdi—the French architect who designed the Statue of Liberty. The new design incorporated the Statue of Liberty, and throughout Europe the 48th became known as the ""Statue of Liberty"" Wing. On 4 July 1954 the mayor of the town of Chaumont bestowed the honorary title of the Statue de la Liberté (Statue of Liberty) Wing upon the 48th. It is the only USAF unit with both an official name and a numerical designation.          In addition, the town of Chaumont donated a bronze statue to the wing which was cast from an original Bartholdi mold built for creating a design model of the Statue of Liberty. The monument still exists today on Chaumont Air Base.          In November 1953, the wing exchanged its F-84Cs for newer F-86F ""Sabre"", receiving 75 aircraft, 25 per squadron. Then in late 1956 that the Air Force would exchange the 48th's Sabers for a newer aircraft: the F-100D ""Super Sabre"".          The larger-bodied F-100 was capable of carrying more ordnance than the F-86 and was one of the first fighters designed to operate at supersonic speeds. 90 single-seat F-100D aircraft were received, along with 13 F-100F dual-seaters.          The wing began realigning its units 15 March 1957, as part of an Air Force worldwide reorganization. Combat groups were inactivated, assigning the unit's fighter mission to the wing. As part of yet another organization change, the 48th dropped the ""Fighter Bomber"" designation 8 July 1958, becoming the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing. The three flying units also changed designation, becoming tactical fighter squadrons.          A change in residence, however, loomed on the horizon for the 48th. Disagreements arose concerning atomic storage and custody issues within NATO, resulting in a decision to remove Air Force atomic-capable units from French soil. Simultaneously, the advent of the inter-continental ballistic missile had reduced the United States’ dependence on European-based airborne medium- and long-range bombers.          On 15 January 1960, the 48 TFW redeployed to RAF Lakenheath, UK. In the early morning, the wing's three fighter squadrons lifted off Chaumont's runway and, after making farewell passes over the outlying village, headed toward the English Channel.          With the departure of the 48th, Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base was placed in reserve status. The base became a satellite of Toul AB, being maintained by the 7544th Combat Support Group.          After almost two years without any permanent flying units, Chaumont Air Base was reactivated as part of Operation Tack Hammer, the United States response to the Berlin Crisis of 1961.          On 1 October 1961, as a result of the Berlin crisis, the New Jersey Air National Guard (ANG) 108th Tactical Fighter Wing was ordered to active duty. When activated, the 108th consisted of three squadrons, the 119th TF Squadron at Atlantic City Airport, the 141st TFSquadron at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, and the 149th TF Squadron at Byrd Field, near Richmond, Virginia. All three squadrons were flying the F-84F Thunderstreak.          Only a portion of the 108th TFW deployed to France due to DOD budget limitations. This consisted of 28 F-84Fs of the 141st TFS and officers and airmen from all three squadrons, with the remaining aircraft and personnel remaining on active duty at their home stations. The first elements of the 108th deployed to Chaumont from McGuire AFB on 16 October with the last aircraft and personnel arriving on 6 November. The ground units deployed by sealift, with the deployed elements reaching Chaumont by 17 November.          In France, the deployed elements of the 108th TFW were designated the 7108th Tactical Wing on 20 November due to the reduced strength of the wing in Europe. The primary mission of the 7108th was to provide close air support to the Seventh Army in Europe under the direction of Ground Forward Air Controllers. To accomplish this mission, up to 30 sorties were flown each day. Pilots and aircraft were rotated back and forth from Atlantic City and Richmond in order for all pilots in the wing to become familiar with flying conditions at Chaumont and to teach USAFE operational procedures.          The 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron from the 7117th Tactical Wing at Dreux-Louvillier Air Base spent all its time in France flying from Chaumont. The 7117th was another Air National Guard wing called to active duty during the Berlin Crisis, but was prohibited from flying its RF-84s from Dreux due to flight restrictions in the Orly Airport area. The 106th remained and operated from Chaumont until its inactivation and departure for CONUS in July 1962.          In April 1962 as the Berlin Crisis subsided, plans were being made to return the activated squadrons to the United States. On 7 June, the 7108th TW received orders directing the wing to return to CONUS with all personnel, but leaving the 24 F-84s in place at Chaumont. In addition, the deployed personnel would assist in the smooth transition of the base to the newly activated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing to be permanently based at Chaumont after their departure.          The 7108th departed from Chaumont and was relieved from active duty in August 1962. All personnel were released from active duty and returned to Air National Guard status.          On 30 April 1962, the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated and assigned to USAFE. It had four Tactical Fighter Squadrons, formed by absorbing the assets and personnel of the Air National Guard squadrons rushed to Europe in the wake of the Berlin Crisis, then as the ANG personnel were demobilized, personnel were drawn from the active-duty ranks. On 8 May 1962 it was reassigned to Seventeenth Air Force. Each squadron flew 20 former ANG F-84Fs.          With Wing Headquarters at Chaumont, the 366th TFW was organized as follows:          The 480th TFS operated at Chaumont until runway repairs were completed at Phalsbourg then deployed there on 20 December. This multi-base organizational structure was unique in that it was the only tactical fighter wing in USAFE with four squadrons at four different air bases in Europe. The 366th was also the last USAFE tactical fighter wing formed in Europe. In addition to the flying units being dispersed, the 366th also formed Combat Support Groups at each base to support the flying operations.          The decision to form, organize, equip and train the 366th at four different bases was a poor decision by USAFE. The first major problem being the simple logistics needed to operate the squadrons. Deliveries of services in France had always been a problem since the USAF bases were established in the early 1950s. Delivery of supplies and equipment sometimes took months, not weeks. In addition, the F-84G was being phased out of the USAF since 1958 and there was a shortage of pilots and trained mechanics in USAFE for the model. Personnel issues such as married personnel avoiding assignments in France due to poor housing conditions meant that most assigned personnel were first-term airmen with little, or elementary job skills. Also, the cost of maintaining USAFE bases in France were significantly higher.          Transition to the newer F-84F began in the fall of 1962, however in the middle of the pilot upgrade training, the 366th was needed to respond to the Cuban Missile Crisis, assuming a 24/7 alert posture for two weeks beginning on 23 October. Some deployed aircraft were called back from Wheelus Air Base Libya where they were undergoing training. Targets in Eastern Europe were identified and changed on a daily, sometimes hourly schedule. Two KB-50 tankers were flown into Chaumont to provide aerial refueling to the tactical aircraft if necessary. On 5 November, the 24/7 alert was stood down and operations returned to normal peacetime levels.          Unlike their Air National Guard predecessors, HQ USAFE did not provide the 366th with a definitive mission statement. The wing simply continued to build on the 7108th Tactical Wing's missions. These were expanded to include the capability to receive and support dual-based CONUS tactical fighter squadrons. Plans were made for the 366th to absorb up to four additional fighter squadrons and operate from three additional NATO Dispersed Operating Bases.          A result of French president Charles de Gaulle's deep suspicion of ""supranational organizations"" and France's shift away from the NATO orbit in the early 1960s ultimately led to the decision in November 1962 that Chambley, Chaumont, Etain and Phalsbourg air bases would be returned to reserve status.          On 26 April 1963, the 366 TFW was notified of its pending relocation to Holloman AFB, New Mexico. The initial deployment of personnel began on 4 June. Personnel and equipment were either moved to Holloman, or reassigned throughout USAFE. The 366th officially departed Chaumont on 22 July 1963.          After the departure of the 366 TFW, Chaumont was in a reserve status, being used occasionally for NATO exercises and deployments. A small USAF contingent group, the 7366th Combat Support Group operated at the base to maintain its facilities.          On 7 March 1966, French President Charles de Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by 1 April 1967.          By the end of 1966, all USAF equipment was removed from Chaumont, and on 26 March 1967 the last American assigned to Chaumont left the facility and the base was turned over to French control.          After the USAF withdrawal from France in 1967, the French Army took up residence at Chaumont, changing its name to Quartier General d'Aboville. The 403 Régiment d'artillerie (403e RA) operated from the installation. Detachments of the Regiment participated in the 1991 Gulf War, the humanitarian intervention in Rwanda, peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and Bosnia and various internal security system operations of the 'Vigipirate' and 'Polmar' type. The Regiment was disbanded on the 30th June 1999.          In 1999, the French Army 61 Régiment d'artillerie (61e RA) Aerial Surveillance Regiment arrived at Chaumont equipped with the CL 289 drone.          The 61st Artillery regiment has deployed on NATO exercises to Bosnia and Kosovo.          In addition to the Army, the French militarised police Force (Gendarmerie Nationale) has also taken up residence at Chaumont-Semoutiers.","['French Army installations', 'Airports established in 1952']"

4689915,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4689915,Limit switch,"In electrical engineering a limit switch is a switch operated by the motion of a machine part or presence of an object.           They are used for controlling machinery as part of a control system, as a safety interlocks, or to count objects passing a point. A limit switch is an electromechanical device that consists of an actuator mechanically linked to a set of contacts. When an object comes into contact with the actuator, the device operates the contacts to make or break an electrical connection.          Limit switches are used in a variety of applications and environments because of their ruggedness, ease of installation, and reliability of operation. They can determine the presence or absence, passing, positioning, and end of travel of an object. They were first used to define the limit of travel of an object; hence the name ""Limit Switch"".          Standardized limit switches are industrial control components manufactured with a variety of operator types, including lever, roller plunger, and whisker type. Limit switches may be directly mechanically operated by the motion of the operating lever. A reed switch may be used to indicate proximity of a magnet mounted on some moving part. Proximity switches operate by the disturbance of an electromagnetic field, by capacitance, or by sensing a magnetic field.          Rarely, a final operating device such as a lamp or solenoid valve will be directly controlled by the contacts of an industrial limit switch, but more typically the limit switch will be wired through a control relay, a motor contactor control circuit, or as an input to a programmable logic controller.          Miniature snap-action switch may be used for example as components of such devices as photocopiers, computer printers, convertible tops or microwave ovens to ensure internal components are in the correct position for operation and to prevent operation when access doors are opened. A set of adjustable limit switches are installed on a garage door opener to shut off the motor when the door has reached the fully raised or fully lowered position. A numerical control machine such as a lathe will have limit switches to identify maximum limits for machine parts or to provide a known reference point for incremental motions.

48723042,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48723042,RNAi nanoparticles to target cancer,"Cancer treatments may vary depending on what type of cancer is being targeted, but one challenge remains in all of them: it is incredibly difficult to target without killing good cells. Cancer drugs and therapies all have very low selective toxicity. However, with the help of nanotechnology and RNA silencing, new and better treatments may be on the horizon for certain forms of cancer.           The main obstacle in using RNAi technology for the treatment of cancer is protecting the RNAi. It is very fragile, quickly metabolized, and it has to efficiently be delivered to the target cells in vivo. This is why nanoparticles are being used. The nanoparticles currently used in experimental trials are usually nanoplexes, polyplexes, lipoplexes, or micelles. These four major types of nanoparticles are all nonionic lipids. Nonionic lipids are safe, nontoxic and biocompatible. Nanoplexes involve the nucleic acid (RNAi) being associated with the particle or encapsulated by it. Polyplexes are core-shell type nanoparticles. Lipoplexes are liposome structures characterized by a bilayer lipid membrane. Lastly, micelles result from electrostatic interaction between nucleic acids and copolymers.           Chemokines are used in the communication between cells. In the case of ovarian clear cell carcinoma, gro-α and its receptor have been found to be overexpressed. This pro-inflammatory cytokine, when found in excess, is involved in tumor cell migration, invasion, and eventually metastasis.           A modified nanoparticle with siRNA is now being researched and has been shown to effectively shut down the expression of gro-α. They are modified with FSH β which has a high selectivity for FSHR-positive ovarian cancer cells. The nanoparticles are aiding in delivery of the siRNA to the correct place, giving them a high selective toxicity.          Multidrug resistance in cancer cells is thought to be the primary reason for the poor efficacy of cancer chemotherapy. Drug resistance is due to expression of the gene MDR-1. These gene codes for membrane-bound proteins called ABC transporters. One example of an ABC transporter is P-glycoprotein (P-gp). These transporters use ATP to efflux drugs out of the cell before they can exhibit their cytotoxic effects.          Nanoparticles with MDR-1 silencing siRNA along with a cytotoxic drug PTX. Using this nanoparticle for delivery, silencing of the MDR-1 gene was achieved. Also, the cytotoxic effect of PTX was enhanced, probably due to an increase in intracellular drug accumulation.          In prostate cancer, the androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in progression of the cancer. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are being considered for delivering siRNA to silence AR. The most effective LNP to be found in vivo contains an ionizable cationic lipid 2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLin-KC2-DMA).          Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an antigen that is present in high levels in prostate cancer. PSA levels following injection of these nanoparticles decreased and AR gene expression in tumors decreased.           Papillary thyroid carcinoma is targeted using a polyplex nanoparticle. The core consists of biodegradable poly isobutylcyanoacrylate polymer and a shell of chitosan. After intravenous injection of this type of nanoparticle loaded with antisense siRNA, tumor growth was almost stopped entirely. All other control experiments showed a ten-times increase in tumor size.","['Targeted therapy', 'RNA interference']"

4617019,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4617019,Jarbidge River,"The Jarbidge River is a , high altitude river in northern Nevada and southwest Idaho in the United States. The Jarbidge originates as two main forks in the Jarbidge Mountains of northeastern Nevada and then flows through basalt and rhyolite canyons on the high plateau of the Owyhee Desert before joining the Bruneau River.          The small town of Jarbidge, Nevada is located on the main stream, the source of which is Jarbidge Lake (). The town of Murphy Hot Springs, Idaho is located on the river's main tributary, the East Fork Jarbidge River, about two miles above the confluence of the streams (); this is the last road access to the river canyon until the Bruneau River. For approximately this narrow river twists and turns northwest through a remarkable canyon, deep and rugged, but often dotted with groves of juniper trees along the banks. The Jarbidge Canyon is about deep at the confluence of the forks, and about deep at the confluence with the Bruneau. Once joining the Bruneau, the waters flow on to the Snake River and ultimately the Columbia River; therefore, it is one of very few rivers in northern Nevada that eventually empties into the Pacific Ocean. Tributaries include Buck Creek, Dave Creek, Columbet Creek, Dorsey Creek, Cougar Creek, and Poison Creek.          The river is quite cold; though swimming is possible, there is a danger of hypothermia. Flow rates vary wildly. Kayaking is possible in certain sections in early summer; class IV. The river can also be run by experienced rafters. For rafters, the run can be arduous, with log jams inevitably requiring portages, lining rafts down rapids, or simply heaving rafts up and over the blockage. For the well-seasoned and adventurous, however, this river provides a spectacular journey filled with class III and IV rapids before the Jarbidge runs into the Bruneau River. Rafters and kayakers should be aware that towards the end of this run (approximately 25 miles below Murphy Hot Springs), looms Jarbidge Falls. Jarbidge Falls is a class V+ run and should only be run by expert kayakers. A huge, row home-sized boulder blocking half the river signals the beginning of this rapid.          Access to the river is preferably via 4 wheel drive or ATV. The Big Bend (National Forest Service) campground is located nearby (8 miles) and is suitable for day-tripping to the river. Access is near impossible from other locations in Nevada until about June/July due to snowdrifts across the mountainous access roads; otherwise access is from Idaho.          The headwaters of the Jarbidge River are protected as the Jarbidge Wilderness, managed by the Jarbidge Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The Jarbidge River below the confluence with the East Fork is protected in the new Bruneau - Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness, which was created by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 and signed into law on March 30, 2009.          The Jarbidge River is home to a small population of threatened bull trout (""Salvelinus confluentus""). Bull trout inhabit both forks of the Jarbidge River, as well as several tributaries. This small population is on the southern edge of the species' range, and is isolated from other populations of bull trout in southern Idaho, increasing their sensitivity to changes in habitat. Population densities were estimated at 10–20 fish per km in 1996. Columbia River redband trout also inhabit the river.","['Rivers and streams of Nevada', 'Rivers and streams of Idaho', 'Landforms of Owyhee County, Idaho', 'Landforms of Elko County, Nevada']"

41760410,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41760410,Luis Guillermo Solís,"Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera (born 25 April 1958) is a Costa Rican politician who has been President of Costa Rica since 2014. He is a member of the center-left Citizens' Action Party (PAC). Solís led the field in the 2014 presidential election, and he was effectively handed the presidency after the runner-up in the first round, San José mayor Johnny Araya Monge, ceased active campaigning. Solís has a long academic and political career, culminating in his election as the first President of Costa Rica to be a member of the PAC.          Solís was born in San José, Costa Rica to Vivienne Rivera Allen, an educator, and Freddy Solís Avendaño, an uneducated shoemaker. Both his parents lived in Turrialba, and as such many residents consider him Turrialban. His family has Afro-Caribbean and Chinese roots, coming from Jamaica to Costa Rica in the early 1900s. Solís grew up in San Pedro de Montes de Oca and Curridabat, neighborhoods of San José. He attended Methodist High School in San José, where he was president of the student body, before studying history at the University of Costa Rica, where he earned a degree with academic honors in 1979. He earned a master's degree in Latin American Studies at Tulane University in New Orleans.          Solís has held various academic and consulting positions. Between 1981 and 1987, he was an associate professor at the University of Costa Rica. In addition, he was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Michigan from 1983 to 1985. During this time, Solís worked with the Arias administration and eventually became director of the Center for Peace and Reconciliation (CPR for its Spanish initials). From 1992 to 1995, Solís worked with the Academic Council of the United Nations System. Starting in 1999, Solís worked for Florida International University as coordinator in the Center for the Administration of Justice and as a researcher for the Latin American and Caribbean Center, where he analyzed political and social events in Latin America.          A writer and editorial writer, Solís has published numerous essays and books about national and international affairs. In the 1990s, he wrote for ""La República"", a daily newspaper based in San José. His writing has been published by Foreign Affairs Latinoamérica, Frontera Norte, Espacios and Global Governance. His writing has focused on civil society, international relations, and trade.          While still at UCR, Solís joined the National Liberation Party (PLN for its Spanish initials) in 1977. Solís was an adviser to Óscar Arias in the Foreign Ministry, working on the Esquipulas Peace Agreement for which Arias would later win a Nobel Peace Prize. Solís served as Director of International Relations for the PLN. During José María Figueres Olsen's time in office, Solís was ambassador of Central American Affairs.          In 2002, Solís followed Rolando González Ulloa as General Secretary of the PLN, a position he resigned from the following year, citing his disappointment with the Alcatel-Lucent bribery scandal that many PLN leaders were involved in. In 2005, he denounced the PLN for irregularities and corruption during party elections, along with a host of former PLN members. Solís went as far as to call the PLN leadership ""Napoleonic"" and ""anti-democratic"". He officially renounced his affiliation with the party and returned to academics.          After the 2006 election, Solís' name began to come up in PAC circles, particularly at meetings of the ""ungroup,"" an informal gathering of PAC officials, led by former deputy and former Vice President of the National University of Costa Rica Alberto Salom Echeverría. Ottón Solís, one of PAC's founders and three-time presidential candidate, suggested that Luis Guillermo Solís run as a vice presidential candidate in 2010. Luis Guillermo Solis rejected the offer because he was working for the General Secretariat of Ibero-America (SEGIB for its Spanish initials), and employees of SEGIB were not allowed to participate in elections.          In 2009, Luis Guillermo Solís began his official affiliation with PAC. He began attending meetings of the ""ungroup"" in 2010. Within the party, PAC leader María Eugenia Venegas recognized Solís' potential and pushed for him to be elevated within the party. Solís undertook several trips around the country to meet with national and provincial PAC leaders.          Solís announced his candidacy for president on 27 November 2012. In the PAC's primary, he ran against Epsy Campbell Barr, Juan Carlos Mendoza García, and Ronald Solís Bolaños, winning with 35 percent of the vote, only 110 votes more than Juan Carlos Mendoza García.          In October 2013, he chose Helio Fallas and Ana Helena Chacón Echeverría as his Vice-Presidential running mates. Among his aims, Solís claimed he would clean up corruption, create major investments in infrastructure, and shore up Costa Rica's universal health care and social security system. He also promised to continue initiatives to keep Costa Rica environmentally friendly. He said that he would ""put the brakes"" on new free trade agreements and would begin correctly administrating current free trade agreements. As such, Solís received a tremendous amount of political support from the country's trade unions Costa Rica's trade unions.          On 2 February 2014, Solís won the most votes in the election with 30.95 percent. PLN candidate Johnny Araya came second with 29.95 percent of the vote. Most of Solís' support came from the Central Valley provinces of San José, Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago.          Because no candidate exceeded 40 percent of the vote, a second round of voting occurred on 6 April as required by the constitution. Before that, on 5 March, Araya announced that he would abandon his campaign after polls showed him far behind Solís. However, under Costa Rican law the runoff still had to take place, and Solís won with over 77 percent of the vote, the largest margin ever recorded for a free election in Costa Rica. Unlike the first round, Solís earned a majority in every province, including Puntarenas, Limón, and Guanacaste. When he took office on 8 May, he was the first president in 66 years not to come from the PLN or what is now the PUSC.          Immediately after the election, Solís thanked Costa Rican voters. He received congratulatory notes from world leaders, including US Secretary of State John Kerry, Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Bolivian President Evo Morales, and the spokesperson from the French Ministry of International Affairs. For his part, Araya congratulated Solís on his victory, calling for national unity.          A little over a week before taking office, in April 2014, Solís announced the creation of his cabinet. His cabinet consists of mostly PAC members or non-aligned citizens. However, two PUSC members were also added: María del Rocío Sáenz, Abel Pacheco's former health minister, heads the Costa Rican Social Security System (Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social). Delia Villalobos, another former health minister, heads the Social Protection Council (Consejo de Seguridad).          Solís took office on 8 May 2014, amid festive fanfare. Delegations from more than 80 countries attended his inauguration at La Sabana Metropolitan Park, including Prince Felipe de Borbón of Spain, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, and the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, José Miguel Insulza. Solís said, in Costa Rican vernacular, that he is taking over a ""weed farm"" (finca encharralada), pointing out growing income inequality and poverty, as well as a national teachers' strike.          Like most members of PAC, Solís identifies himself as a progressivist. His ""Plan Rescate"", or ""Rescue Plan"", outlines his political beliefs. This plan focused on three central issues: anti-corruption, economic growth, and reducing income inequality.          Solís claims that economic neoliberalism has created too much income inequality for Costa Rica. Past governments have avoided collecting taxes on large companies and high-income earners, leading to budget deficits which Solís claims his administration will fix through better enforcement. Banks should not encourage exports at the expense of income growth among the poor, according to Solís. He believes that economic liberalization has generally harmed women more than men because they have traditionally had less access to higher-income jobs. Part of that liberalization, he claims, included ignoring the financial and growth needs of the agricultural industry.          Solís supports environmental protections, which he believes Costa Rica has forgotten. As such, Solís believes that water must be safeguarded from private development and mismanagement, something that has caused water shortages in many of the country's municipalities. Solís claims that he will prosecute violators of the Water Resources Management Bill.          In addition, Solís supports increased rights for rights for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transsexuals. In May 2014, he ordered that a rainbow flag be flown over the Presidential House as a show of solidarity with gays on International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.          Solís is a Catholic. As a presidential candidate, he visited the basilica of Our Lady of Angels, home to the Costa Rican patron saint La Negrita, a traditional pilgrimage for many Costa Ricans and tourists. He supports the separation of church and state despite Catholicism being the country's official religion. With regard to ethical issues, he also supports civil unions, and in-vitro fertilization.          Solis has five children from his previous marriage to his first wife, Nancy Olive Worsfold Richards (1987–2006): Monica, Cristina, Beatriz, Diego and Ignacio.          Solís is not married to Mercedes Peñas Domingo, but she is altogether considered the First Lady of Costa Rica. He and Peñas, who began dating in 2006, have one daughter, Inés. Peñas said that she hopes to be active as an adviser to Solís, who called her ""Jiminy Cricket."" Saying that some of her duties as First Lady are machista, she will nevertheless greet dignitaries and perform other obligations. In addition to public service and academics, Solís enjoys farming.","['1958 births', 'Catholicism in Costa Rica', ""Citizens' Action Party politicians"", 'Costa Rican people of Chinese descent', 'Costa Rican people of Jamaican descent', 'Costa Rican Roman Catholics', 'Fulbright Scholars', 'Government ministers of Costa Rica', 'Living people', 'People from San Jos\xc3\xa9, Costa Rica', 'Politicians of Chinese descent', 'Presidents of Costa Rica', 'Tulane University alumni', 'University of Michigan alumni', 'University of Costa Rica alumni']"

100076,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100076,MI5,"The Security Service, also MI5 (Military Intelligence, Section 5), is the United Kingdom's domestic counter-intelligence and security agency and is part of its intelligence machinery alongside the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Defence Intelligence (DI). MI5 is directed by the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), and the service is bound by the Security Service Act 1989 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. The service is directed to protect British parliamentary democracy and economic interests, and counter terrorism and espionage within the UK.          Within the civil service community the service is colloquially known as ""Box 500"" (after its official wartime address of PO Box 500; its current address is PO Box 3255, London SW1P 1AE).          The service has had a national headquarters at Thames House on Millbank in London since 1995, drawing together personnel from a number of locations into a single HQ facility. Thames House was, until March 2013, shared with the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) and is also home to the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, a subordinate organisation to the Security Service. The service has offices across the United Kingdom including an HQ in Northern Ireland.          Details of the northern operations centre in Greater Manchester were revealed by the firm who built it. Plans to open the northern operations centre were reported by ""The Manchester Evening News"" in February 2005, and plans to open a permanent Scottish office in Glasgow were reported by ""The Scotsman"" in January of that year.          The Security Service comes under the authority of the Home Secretary within the Cabinet. The service is headed by a Director General at the grade of a Permanent Secretary of the British Civil Service who is directly supported by an internal security organisation, secretariat, legal advisory branch and information services branch. The Deputy DG is responsible for the operational activity of the service, being responsible for four branches; international counter-terrorism, National Security Advice Centre (counter proliferation and counter espionage), Irish and domestic counter-terrorism and technical and surveillance operations.          The service is directed by the Joint Intelligence Committee for intelligence operational priorities. It liaises with SIS, GCHQ, DIS, and a number of other bodies within the British government and industrial base. It is overseen by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Members of Parliament, who are directly appointed by the Prime Minister, by the Interception of Communications Commissioner, and by the Intelligence Services Commissioner. Judicial oversight of the service's conduct is exercised by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.          Operations of the service are required to be proportionate and compliant with British legislation including the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Data Protection Act 1998, and various other items of legislation. Information held by the service is exempt from disclosure under section 23 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.          All employees of the service are bound by the Official Secrets Act.          The current Director General is Andrew Parker, who succeeded Jonathan Evans on 22 April 2013.          The service marked its centenary in 2009 by publishing an official history, written by Christopher Andrew, Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Cambridge University.          The Security Service is derived from the Secret Service Bureau, founded in 1909 and concentrating originally on the activities of the Imperial German government as a joint initiative of the Admiralty and the War Office. The Bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign target espionage and internal counter-espionage activities respectively. This specialisation was a result of the Admiralty intelligence requirements related to the maritime strength of the Imperial German Navy. This specialisation was formalised prior to 1914 and the beginning of World War I, with the two sections undergoing a number of administrative changes and the home section becoming Directorate of Military Intelligence Section 5 (MI5), the name by which it is known in popular culture to this very day.          The founding head of the Army section was Vernon Kell of the South Staffordshire Regiment, who remained in that role until the early part of the Second World War. Its role was originally quite restricted; existing purely to ensure national security through counter-espionage. With a small staff and working in conjunction with the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police, the service was responsible for overall direction and the identification of foreign agents, whilst Special Branch provided the manpower for the investigation of their affairs, arrest and interrogation.          On the day after the declaration of World War I, the Home Secretary, Reginald McKenna, announced that ""within the last twenty-four hours no fewer than twenty-one spies, or suspected spies, have been arrested in various places all over the country, chiefly in important military or naval centres, some of them long known to the authorities to be spies"", a reference to arrests directed by the service. These arrests have provoked recent historical controversy. According to the official history of MI5, the actual number of agents identified was 22 and Kell had started sending out letters to local police forces on 29 July giving them advance warning of arrests to be made as soon as war was declared. Portsmouth Constabulary jumped the gun and arrested one on 3 August, and not all of the 22 were in custody by the time that McKenna made his speech, but the official history regards the incident as a devastating blow to Imperial Germany which deprived them of their entire spy ring, and specifically upset the Kaiser.          This view has been challenged by Nicholas Hiley who has asserted that it is a complete fabrication. In 2006 his article ""Entering the Lists"" was published in the journal ""Intelligence and National Security"" outlining the products of his research into recently opened files. Hiley was sent an advance copy of the official history and objected to the retelling of the story. He later wrote another article, ""Re-entering the Lists"", which asserted that the list of those arrested published in the official history was concocted from later case histories.          After this auspicious start, the history of MI5 becomes darker. It was consistently successful throughout the rest of the 1910s and 1920s in its core counter-espionage role. Throughout World War 1, Germany continued trying to infiltrate Britain but MI5 was able to identify most, if not all, of the agents dispatched. MI5 used a method that depended on strict control of entry and exit to the country and, crucially, large-scale inspection of mail. In post-war years, attention turned to attempts by the Soviet Union and the Comintern to surreptitiously support revolutionary activities within Britain. MI5's expertise, combined with the early incompetence of the Soviets, meant the bureau was successful once more in correctly identifying and closely monitoring these activities.          However, in the meantime, MI5's role had been substantially enlarged. Due to the spy hysteria, MI5 had been formed with far more resources than it actually needed to track down German spies. As is common within governmental bureaucracies, this caused the service to expand its role, to use its spare resources. MI5 acquired many additional responsibilities during the war. Most significantly, its strict counter-espionage role blurred considerably. It became a much more political role, involving the surveillance not merely of foreign agents but also of pacifist and anti-conscription organisations, and of organised labour. This was justified through the common belief that foreign influence was at the root of these organisations. Thus, by the end of the World War 1, MI5 was a fully-fledged investigating force (although it never had powers of arrest), in addition to being a counter-espionage agency. The expansion of this role continued after a brief post-war power struggle with the head of the Special Branch, Sir Basil Thomson.          After World War 1, Kell's department was considered unnecessary by budget-conscious politicians. In 1919, MI5's budget was slashed from £100,000 and over 800 officers to just £35,000 and 12 officers. At the same time, Sir Basil Thomson of Special Branch was appointed Director of Home Intelligence, in supreme command of all domestic counter-insurgency and counter-intelligence investigations. Consequently, as official MI5 historian Christopher Andrew has noted in his official history ""Defence of the Realm"" (2010), MI5 had no clearly defined role in the Anglo-Irish War. And to add insult to injury, several of Kell's officers defected to Thomson's new Agency, the Home Intelligence Directorate. MI5 therefore undertook no tangible intelligence operations of consequence during the Irish War of Independence. MI5 did undertake the training of British Army Case Officers from the Department of Military Intelligence (DMI) for the Army's so-called ""Silent Section"" otherwise known as M04(x). Quickly trained by MI5 veterans at Hounslow Barracks, outside London, these freshly minted M04(x) Army case officers were deployed to Dublin beginning in the Spring of 1919. Over time, 175 officers were trained and dispatched to Ireland. In Ireland, they came under the command of General Romer and his Deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Searles Hill-Dillon.          In April 1919, Colonel Walter Wilson of DMI arrived in Dublin to take over the day-to-day management of these 175 Army intelligence officers, and the unit was designated as the ""Dublin District Special Branch"" (DMI/MO4(x)/DDSB) because it operated exclusively within the confines of the Army's Dublin Military District. Royal Marine Colonel Hugh Montgomery of the Department of Naval Intelligence, was also seconded to Romer's intelligence staff at this time. British Army after-action reports and contemporary accounts indicate that M04(x)/DDSB was considered a highly amateurish outfit. Serious cover constraints, coupled with alcohol abuse and social fraternization with local prostitutes would prove to be the downfall of several of these amateur sleuths.          The intelligence staff of Michael Collins Irish Republican Army penetrated the unit. Using DMP detectives Ned Broy and David Nelligan, Michael Collins was able to learn the names and lodgings of the M04(x) agents, referred to by IRA operatives as ""The Cairo Gang"". On Bloody Sunday, Collins ordered his Counter-intelligence Unit, The Squad, to assassinate 25 M04(x) agents, several British Courts Martial Officers, at least one agent reporting to Basil Thomson, and several intelligence officers attached to the Royal Irish Constabulary Auxiliary Division, at their lodgings throughout Dublin. Although the shooting of 14 British officers had the desired effect on British morale, in many ways Bloody Sunday was a botched job. Three of Collins's men were apprehended after engaging in a shoot-out on the street, and at least 2 of the wounded British officers had no connection whatsoever to British Intelligence. Moreover, with MO4(x) having fielded a total of 175 agents of the DDSB, Collins's operation only temporarily slowed British momentum. Within days, the remaining 160-odd M04(x) agents were re-established in secure quarters inside solidly Loyalist hotels in Dublin, from where they continued to pursue Collins and the IRA relentlessly right up until the Truce. In December 1920 the entire DDSB was transferred from British Army Command to civil command under Deputy Police Commissioner General Ormonde Winter, and thereafter was known as ""D Branch"" within Dublin Castle. By January 1921, the highly experienced MI6 operative David Boyle arrived at Dublin Castle to take over the day-to-day management of D Branch. The unit's former commander, Colonel Wilson, resigned in protest for having had his command taken from him. D Branch thrived under Boyle's leadership. The net impact of Collins's strike of Bloody Sunday, November 21, 1920, was therefore quite negligible—even though the IRA had not gone up against MI5 professionals but instead only a quickly trained outfit of amateur army ""D-Listers.""          That afternoon, a mixed force of the British Army, the Royal Irish Constabulary, and the Black and Tans retaliated by indiscriminately shooting dead 14 civilians at a Gaelic Football match at Croke Park.          In 1921, Sir Warren Fisher, the Government inspector general for civil service affairs, conducted a thorough review of the operations and expenditures of Basil Thomson's Home Intelligence Directorate. He issued a scathing report, accusing Thomson of wasting both money and resources and conducting redundant as well as ineffectual operations. Shortly thereafter, in a private meeting with Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Sir Basil Thomson was sacked, and the Home Intelligence Directorate was formally abolished. With Thomson out of the way, Special Branch was returned to the command of the Commissioner of The Criminal Investigation Division at Scotland Yard. Only then was Vernon Kell able once again to rebuild MI5 and regain its former place as Britain's chief domestic spy agency.          MI5 operated in Italy during inter-war period. MI5 helped Benito Mussolini get his start in politics with the £100 weekly wage.          MI5's decline in counter-espionage efficiency began in the 1930s. It was, to some extent, a victim of its own success. It was unable to break the ways of thinking it had evolved in the 1910s and 1920s. In particular, it was unable to adjust to the new methods of the Soviet intelligence services the NKVD and GRU. It continued to think in terms of agents who would attempt to gather information simply through observation or bribery, or to agitate within labour organisations and the armed services, while posing as ordinary citizens. The NKVD, however, had evolved more sophisticated methods; it began to recruit agents from within the British nobility, most notably from Cambridge University, who were seen as a long-term investment. They succeeded in gaining positions within the Government (and, in Kim Philby's case, within British intelligence itself), from where they were able to provide the NKVD with sensitive information. The most successful of these agents—Harold ""Kim"" Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross—went undetected until after the Second World War, and were known as the Cambridge Five.          MI5 experienced further failure during the Second World War. It was chronically unprepared, both organisationally and in terms of resources, for the outbreak of war, and utterly unequal to the task which it was assigned—the large-scale internment of enemy aliens in an attempt to uncover enemy agents. The operation was poorly handled and contributed to the near-collapse of the agency by 1940. One of the earliest actions of Winston Churchill on coming to power in early 1940 was to sack the agency's long-term head, Vernon Kell. He was replaced initially by the ineffective Brigadier A.W.A. Harker, as Acting Director General. Harker in turn was quickly replaced by David Petrie, an SIS man, with Harker as his deputy. With the ending of the Battle of Britain and the abandonment of invasion plans (correctly reported by both SIS and the Bletchley Park Ultra project), the spy scare eased, and the internment policy was gradually reversed. This eased pressure on MI5, and allowed it to concentrate on its major wartime success, the so-called ""double-cross"" system.          This was a system based on an internal memo drafted by an MI5 officer in 1936, which criticised the long-standing policy of arresting and sending to trial all enemy agents discovered by MI5. Several had offered to defect to Britain when captured; before 1939, such requests were invariably turned down. The memo advocated attempting to ""turn"" captured agents wherever possible, and use them to mislead enemy intelligence agencies. This suggestion was turned into a massive and well-tuned system of deception during the Second World War.          Beginning with the capture of an agent named Owens, codenamed Snow, MI5 began to offer enemy agents the chance to avoid prosecution (and thus the possibility of the death penalty) if they would work as British double-agents. Agents who agreed to this were supervised by MI5 in transmitting bogus ""intelligence"" back to the German secret service, the Abwehr. This necessitated a large-scale organisational effort, since the information had to appear valuable but actually be misleading. A high-level committee, the Wireless Board, was formed to provide this information. The day-to-day operation was delegated to a subcommittee, the Twenty Committee (so called because the Roman numerals for twenty, XX, form a double cross).          The system was extraordinarily successful. A postwar analysis of German intelligence records found that of the 115 or so agents targeted against Britain during the war, all but one (who committed suicide) had been successfully identified and caught, with several ""turned"" to become double agents. The system played a major part in the massive campaign of deception which preceded the D-Day landings, designed to give the Germans a false impression of the location and timings of the landings (see Operation Fortitude).          All foreigners entering the country were processed at the London Reception Centre (LRC) at the Royal Patriotic School which was operated by MI5 subsection B1D, 30,000 were inspected at LRC. Captured enemy agents were taken to Camp 020, Latchmere House, for interrogation. This was commanded by Colonel Robin Stephens. There was a Reserve Camp, Camp 020R, at Huntercombe which was used mainly for long term detention of prisoners.          The Prime Minister's personal responsibility for the Service was delegated to the Home Secretary Maxwell-Fyfe in 1952, with a directive issued by the Home Secretary setting out the role and objectives of the Director General. The service was subsequently placed on a statutory basis in 1989 with the introduction of the Security Service Act. This was the first government acknowledgement of the existence of the service.          The post-war period was a difficult time for the Service with a significant change in the threat as the Cold War began, being challenged by an extremely active KGB and increasing incidence of the Northern Ireland conflict and international terrorism. Whilst little has yet been released regarding the successes of the service there have been a number of intelligence failures which have created embarrassment for both the service and the government. For instance in 1983 one of its officers, Michael Bettaney, was caught trying to sell information to the KGB. He was subsequently convicted of espionage.          Following the Michael Bettaney case, Philip Woodfield was appointed as a staff counsellor for the security and intelligence services. His role was to be available to be consulted by any member or former member of the security and intelligence services who had ""anxieties relating to the work of his or her service"" that it had not been possible to allay through the ordinary processes of management-staff relations, including proposals for publications.          The Service was instrumental in breaking up a large Soviet spy ring at the start of the 1970s, with 105 Soviet embassy staff known or suspected to be involved in intelligence activities being expelled from the country in 1971.          One episode involving MI5 and the BBC came to light in the mid-1980s. MI5 officer Ronnie Stonham had an office in the BBC and took part in vetting procedures.          Controversy arose when it was alleged that the service was monitoring trade unions and left-wing politicians. A file was kept on Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson from 1945, when he became an MP, although the agency's official historian, Christopher Andrew maintains that his fears of MI5 conspiracies and bugging were unfounded. As Home Secretary, the Labour MP Jack Straw discovered the existence of his own file dating from his days as a student radical.          One of the most significant and far reaching failures was an inability to conclusively detect and apprehend the ""Cambridge Five"" spy ring which had formed in the inter-war years and achieved great success in penetrating the government, and the intelligence agencies themselves. Related to this failure were suggestions of a high-level penetration within the service, Peter Wright (especially in his controversial book ""Spycatcher"") and others believing that evidence implicated the former Director General, Roger Hollis or his deputy Graham Mitchell. The Trend inquiry of 1974 found the case unproven of that accusation, and that view was later supported by the former KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky. Another spy ring, the Portland Spy Ring, exposed after a tip-off by Soviet defector Michael Goleniewski, led to an extensive MI5 surveillance operation.          There have been strong accusations leveled against MI5 for having failed in its obligation to provide care for former police agents who had infiltrated the Provisional IRA during the Troubles. The two most notable of the agents, Martin McGartland and Raymond Gilmour, are presently residing in England using false identities and in 2012 launched test cases against the agency. Both men claimed to journalist Liam Clarke in the ""Belfast Telegraph"" that they were abandoned by MI5 and were ""left high and dry despite severe health problems as a result of their work and lavish promises of life-time care from their former Intelligence bosses"". Both men suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.          The end of the Cold War resulted in a change in emphasis for the operations of the service, assuming responsibility for the investigation of all Irish republican activity within Britain and increasing the effort countering other forms of terrorism, particularly in more recent years the more widespread threat of Islamic extremism.          Whilst the British security forces in Northern Ireland have provided support in the countering of both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups since the early 1970s, republican sources have often accused these forces of collusion with loyalists. In 2006, an Irish government committee inquiry found that there was widespread collusion between British security forces and loyalist terrorists in the 1970s, which resulted in eighteen deaths. In 2012, a legal review by Sir Desmond de Silva QC into the 1989 murder of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane found that MI5, along with British Military intelligence and RUC Special Branch was found to have colluded in furthering and facilitating his death. MI5 had overall supervision of the intelligence gathering in Northern Ireland during the troubles, a secret MI5 document released revealed that in 1985, 85% of the UDA's intelligence was from security force sources. Prime Minister David Cameron accepted the findings and apologised on behalf of the British government and acknowledged significant levels of collusion with Loyalists in its state agencies.          The Security Service took responsibility for all security intelligence work in Northern Ireland from 2007 from the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Both Nuala O'Loan, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, and Al Hutchinson, the Oversight Commissioner of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, expressed reservations. During April 2010 the Real IRA detonated a 120 lb. car bomb outside Palace Barracks in County Down which is the headquarters of MI5 in Northern Ireland and also home to the 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment.          MI5 is understood to have a close working relationship with the Republic of Ireland's Special Detective Unit (SDU), the counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence section of the Garda Síochána (national police), particularly with regards to threats from dissident republican terrorism and Islamic terrorism.          Executive Liaison Groups enable MI5 to safely share secret, sensitive, and often raw intelligence with the police, on which decisions can be made about how best to gather evidence and prosecute suspects in the courts. Each organisation works in partnership throughout the investigation, but MI5 retain the lead for collecting, assessing and exploiting intelligence. The police take lead responsibility for gathering evidence, obtaining arrests and preventing risks to the public.          In 1996, legislation formalised the extension of the Security Service's statutory remit to include supporting the law enforcement agencies in their work against serious crime. Tasking was reactive, acting at the request of law enforcement bodies such as the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), for whom MI5 agents performed electronic surveillance and eavesdropping duties during Operation Trinity. This role has subsequently been passed to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and then the National Crime Agency. (NCA)          In 2001, after the September 11 attacks in the U.S., MI5 started collecting bulk telephone communications data on which telephone numbers called each other and when, authorised under a little understood general power under the Telecommunications Act 1984 instead of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 would have brought independent oversight and regulation. This was kept secret until announced by the Home Secretary in 2015.          In July 2006, parliamentarian Norman Baker accused the British Government of ""hoarding information about people who pose no danger to this country"", after it emerged that MI5 holds secret files on 272,000 individuals—equivalent to one in 160 adults.          It was later revealed that a ""traffic light"" system operates:          Although commonly referred to as ""MI5"", this was the Service's official name for only thirteen years (1916–29). However, as an acknowledgment of popular thought, ""MI5"" is used as a sub-title on the various pages of the official Security Service website (see links, below).","['MI5', '1909 establishments in the United Kingdom', 'British intelligence agencies', 'Buildings and structures in the City of Westminster', 'Intelligence services of World War II']"

Oberliga West () was the second-highest level of the German football league system in the west of Germany from 1949 until the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963. It covered the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state of Germany.          The 2. Oberliga West was formed in 1949 with two groups of sixteen teams each, as a feeder league to Oberliga West. It was the first of the three 2nd Oberligas, the other two being 2. Oberliga Süd (formed in 1950) and 2. Oberliga Südwest (in 1951). The league adopted a single group format starting from 1952: The top two teams of the 2. Oberliga gained promotion to the Oberliga while the bottom two teams were relegated to the ""Verbandsliga""'s. Some years, however, exceptions applied and the number of promoted and relegated teams altered.          In July 1955 the ""Westdeutschen Fußballverband"" decided to disband the league from 1956, but the German federation ""DFB"" outlawed this decision and the league continued its existence.          Below the 2. Oberliga West ranked the ""Amateurliga""'s, varying in numbers (and names) but split into three zones, ""Niederrhein"", ""Mittelrhein"", and ""Westfalen"" :          The 2.

The front stretch can see vehicles reaching speeds of . Smaller configurations of the track can be made from the full course, including a outer course that does not use the tighter infield lay-out, as well as two layouts that each use half of the full course and can be run simultaneously. At almost , it was the longest road racing facility in North America until the 2014 extension of Thunderhill Raceway Park. It is about ½ mile (0.8 km) longer than the previous holder, Road America.

Located to the North of the main track Utah Motorsports Campus also contains a kart track that can be configured as a first-rate supermoto track with the inclusion of two dirt sections. The main straight approaches in length and in width.           The facility has a paddock that contains 220 team garages, 40 day garages, 27 grand prix garages located along the hot pits, an on-site medical facility, five million dollar Club House, vintage car museum, and a helicopter pad.          During the annual Tour of Utah bicycle race, the park is known for hosting the tour's ""trademark"" time-trial stage.          This track was originally conceived as a novelty track for Larry H. Miller, owner of the NBA's Utah Jazz and various automobile dealerships in the area, to use as a personal playground, with a budget of about $5 million. Due to enormous local motorcycle and auto industry support the concept gradually grew into an $85 million plus project, one of a kind in the U.S.          The track was designed by world-renowned track designer Alan Wilson.           The kart track was opened in September 2005 and the large track was opened to the public on 1 April 2006 for the first motorcycle track day.           In 2006, the track's first year of operation, it hosted the Utah Grand Prix with the American Le Mans Series, a Honda Summit of Speed AMA Superbike double-header event, and the Discount Tire Sunchaser, a nine-hour endurance race of the Rolex Sports Car Series. The Sunchaser was shortened to 1,000 km (620 miles) for 2007 and 2008, and to 250 miles for 2009 and 2010.          The track is also host to a WERA Grand National motorcycle roadracing event and the regional motorcycle road racing series Masters of the Mountains, promoted by the Utah sport bike association.           The facility was named Motorsports Facility of the Year on 8 November 2006 by the Professional Motorsport World Expo in Cologne, Germany.          On 14 July 2007, the track hosted its first-ever NASCAR event with a Grand National West Series race on the Outer Track. The series has visited Miller every year since then, having switched to the outer course.          On 22 August 2007, Miller Motorsports Park announced a three-year deal to bring the FIM Superbike World Championship to the track; the Superbike World Championship will race at the track for the first time on 1 June 2008 with the AMA Superbike Championship. To avoid direct comparisons between World Superbike and AMA Superbike, and because of sponsorship issues, the two championships will race on different configurations of the circuit. World Superbike will use the Outer course, while AMA Superbike and its support classes will use the Full course.          The American Le Mans Series and Rolex Sports Car Series did not return to the Utah Grand Prix for 2011, and a K&N Pro Series West race was substituted. It was also announced that AMA Superbike would return to the track in 2011 with World Superbike.          It was announced on May 8, 2015 that the Larry H. Miller Group of Companies would not renew the lease on the land in Tooele County, Utah on which the park sits. The last day of operation will be October 31, 2015.          According to local news sources, as of July 17, 2015, there were several offers being considered by the Tooele County commissioners that would provide for the facility to continue operation.           On October 13, 2015, Tooele County voted to approve the sale of Miller Motorsports Park to Mitime Investment and Development Group (subsidiary of Geely). Mitime is purchasing the property from Tooele County for $20 million dollars. The track will be renamed, and known as Utah Motorsports Campus. Mitime officially took over the property on October 31, 2015.           On December 17, 2015, an order filed in 3rd District Court vacated the sale of Miller Motorsports Park to Mitime Investment and Development Group, saying Tooele County shortchanged another bidder by unlawfully selling the property at a price significantly below fair market value. Two days later, Tooele County's commissioners said that the bidding for the purchase of the property would be reopened.          On February 1, 2016, Mitime took over the management of the facility on behalf of Tooele County. This is a temporary agreement for 2016 while the county goes through the process of selling the facility. As of May 2016, there were pending legal challenges to the sale, but the facility opened for business as the Utah Motorsports Campus.","['Superbike World Championship circuits', 'Motorsport venues in Utah', 'American Le Mans Series circuits', 'Buildings and structures in Tooele County, Utah', 'Visitor attractions in Tooele County, Utah', 'Sports venues completed in 2006', 'Off-road racing venues in the United States', 'Museums in Tooele County, Utah', 'Transportation museums in Utah']"

It is licensed to Glasgow, Kentucky, USA, and serving Glasgow, Bowling Green, and the Caveland area of south-central Kentucky, the station is owned by Royse Radio, Incorporated.          The station has an estimated sign on date of September 23, 1946 as WKAY, the first of two radio stations originally owned by Glasgow Broadcasting, Inc., along with WGGC-FM when it signed on sometime in 1961. Original studios were located at 510 Happy Valley Road in Glasgow, which was demolished in November 2014 to make room for a new drug store. The station's original transmitting tower was made entirely of worth of oil well casing, because the owner couldn't afford to really erect a tower, especially during World War II. A real tower wasn't erected until 1963, two years after their then-sister station WGGC signed on.          The station was purchased by its current owner, Royse Radio, in 1988, changing the station's call letters to the current WCLU afterwards. In 1991, WCLU moved into a new facility on West Main Street in downtown Glasgow.          The station's oldies format is also accompanied with local talk radio programming, including local newscasts, and local sports coverage.

7874616,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7874616,Sana Maulit Muli,"Sana Maulit Muli (lit. I Wish It Could Happen Again) is a Filipino primetime soap opera produced by ABS-CBN. It was considered as one of the most watched television shows in the Philippines from January 8, 2007 to April 27, 2007. In Taiwan, the soap premiered on February 18, 2008 with the title, ""Chances"" (真愛奇緣 Zhēn Aì Qí Yúan).          Sana Maulit Muli is about two young lovers who discover how true love can overpower fate and destiny. Small-town girl Jasmin Sta. Maria (Kim Chiu) and Travis Johnson (Gerald Anderson), the illegitimate son of an American soldier, meet as stowaways in a ship sailing from Cebu. They promise to write each other as they were separated; this promise is intercepted as soon as Camille Soriano (Erich Gonzales) deceives Travis by writing to him as Jasmin. In time, Travis' father dies and their family leaves for the Philippines only to meet up with Camille and consequently Jasmin. A rocky start between Jasmin and Travis (when Jasmin was assigned to tutor him after a school brawl) turns into friendship then real love. Jasmin learns later on of Camille's deception and soon after learns that Camille is her younger sister. To make amends with her sister, Jasmin gives away everything for Camille's happiness leading to the break-up. Due to the taunting of Travis' brother Brandon, a twist ensues as Jasmin dies by a bus accident.          Given a chance to change destiny by the mysterious Mang Andres (Michael de Mesa), Travis leaps back in time to be with the person that he loves. Also, Brandon (Jake Cuenca) falls in love with Bianca (Neri Naig), Clara's (Glydel Mercado) sister. Clara is also Camille's stepmom. Jasmin's mother (Mickey Ferriols) is the true mother of Camille, which means Jasmin and Camille are sisters. But Camille does not know the truth.          Brandon is falling head over heels for Bianca and she does as well, after all his sweet visits to her photo shop. (Bianca is a photographer from Boston who moves back because of the breakup of her boyfriend.) Finally, Bianca gives in, and she accepts Brandon, sleeping in his condo for the night which results to her getting pregnant.          Travis attempts to let Jasmin love him but the fact that Jasmin does not know about their love hinders him. Despite Mang Andres request to Travis of not to reveal what he knows about the past, he stubbornly continues to try to change everything. Every time Travis reveals something from the past, it ultimately causes a ripple in time. For one, he confronts Camille about her lie on being Poknat. Camille insists that she is indeed the real Poknat by singing Poknat and Bokbok's song and showing Travis the heart of the friendship, the sandal (which in Book 1 Camille did not have). Thus, instead of trying to gain Jasmin's love again, Travis could ultimately be changing the fabric of time for the worse; for example, Clara, Camille's stepmom, dies of a fire because of Travis. Jasmin realizes because of her life that Travis is saving, other people are dying in exchange for her life. But earlier, because Travis saved at the bet, Jasmin and Travis won't be disturbed by him and they can finally be together again. As the time comes closer, Travis tries to save Jasmin's life but is mistaken to have mental problems since his paranoia for Jasmin's safety is becoming worse. He's then confined in a hospital.          As the night of Jasmin's death comes, Travis goes through different escapades to escape the hospital, to save her. Finally getting to see each other, Jasmin, still afraid but willing to die, promises to fight for her life. As the moment arrives, an out-of-control truck hits Jasmin and Travis, which left Jasmin safe and Travis in critical condition. Fully shocked by what had happened, Jasmin makes a deal with Mang Andres to keep Travis alive, in exchange for her life. But all plans fail when Travis pursues to die to save Jasmin from dying again. Just in time Jasmin is saved by her parents. Opposite from Book 1, everyone mourns Travis' death, except for Jasmine, because she believes in her heart that Travis and she will be together again. Before going back to the United States, Travis' mother, Monica, leaves all of his belongings to Jasmin, as she knows Travis would've wanted her to have them. Jasmin sees the watch that brought Travis back in time. Jasmin goes back in time, during her happiest times with Travis and far away from danger.          With that happening, Mang Andres finally decides to let Jasmin and Travis be, leaving all of them happy and alive. In conclusion, Brandon and Bianca are a happy couple, married and in love, with a new baby son. Jasmin goes to law school and Travis becomes a doctor. She soon graduates and becomes a successful lawyer. Camille becomes a happy teacher. Jasmin and Travis soon marry and are happily together.

3748130,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3748130,Dave Bickler,"Dave Bickler (born March 31, 1953) is an American vocalist, best known as the lead singer for the rock band Survivor from 1978–1983. His distinctive vocal was featured on the #1 U.S. hit ""Eye of the Tiger"". In addition to his wide vocal range, his street-wise image included a trademark beret. Bickler would go on to provide the vocals in advertisements, including the ""Real Men of Genius"" Bud Light TV and radio commercials.          Born in North Dakota, Bickler graduated from Benet Academy in Lisle, Illinois. Bickler's career began in 1968 as one of two lead singers and a musician in the early 1970s American rock group Jamestown Massacre. The Jamestown Massacre single ""Summer Sun"" was a Billboard Top 100 and Easy Listening chart entry in the summer of 1972. Bickler met Jim Peterik while doing commercial jingles in the mid-1970s, leading to their future partnership in the band Survivor.           Bickler currently lives with his family in Chappaqua, a suburb of New York City.          On February 2, 2012, he appeared on ""The Colbert Report"" singing a passage from ""Newt Gingrich's"" book ""A Nation Like No Other"" to the tune of ""Eye of the Tiger"".          In 2009, Dave Bickler posted several new songs he was writing & recording for a future solo project via his Twitter account & website. As of October 2015, the songs have yet to be released.          Bickler is best known as an original member of Survivor from 1978 to 1983. He rejoined with Co-Founders Frankie Sullivan & Jim Peterik in 1993 staying until early 2000. He was a part of the group for their first four albums: ""Survivor"", ""Premonition"", ""Eye of The Tiger"" and ""Caught in the Game"". Although primarily serving as the band's lead vocalist during this time, he is also credited with playing keyboards on Survivor's first two albums (including being the sole keyboardist on their debut album, before rhythm guitarist Jim Peterik began to take over the role on ""Premonition"", although future releases would see Peterik replaced in-studio by session musicians).          Survivor experienced their big breakthrough in 1982, when they were asked by Sylvester Stallone to provide the theme song for his movie ""Rocky III"". The song, ""Eye of the Tiger"", soon turned into one of the biggest hits of the band's career. It had an enormous impact on the ""Billboard"" charts, soaring to #1 for seven weeks. The song won the band a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal, was voted ""Best New Song"" by the People's Choice Awards and received an Academy Award nomination. Thanks to the song's success and another Top 20 single, ""American Heartbeat"", the album ""Eye of the Tiger"" peaked at #2 on the ""Billboard"" 200 chart. The song remains popular today. It came in at #18 on the ""Top 100 Singles"" chart in Billboard's 100th Anniversary issue and it is well over the 300,000 mark on the iTunes Store, where it once held #9 on their ""Top Soundtrack"" chart.          Bickler also can be heard on other Survivor singles including ""Somewhere In America"", ""Rebel Girl"", ""Poor Man's Son"", ""Summer Nights"", ""The One That Really Matters"", ""American Heartbeat"", ""Caught In The Game"" and ""Ever Since the World Began"" (this song has a version that was featured on the ""Lock Up"" movie soundtrack with the voice of Jimi Jamison).          Bickler left the band in late 1983 after he developed polyps on his vocal cords and required surgery and voice rest, a condition that would take a year and a half to recuperate from. Bickler was also unhappy about his lack of a bigger payday he felt was owed him for the multi-platinum success the band had from their hit album ""Eye of The Tiger"" released a year earlier. After leaving Survivor, Bickler continued recording with other groups in the Chicago area and doing commercial jingles and ads.          Bickler rejoined Survivor in early 1993 as lead vocalist for a ""Greatest Hits"" album on Scotti Bros. featuring two new songs ""You Know Who You Are"" and ""Hungry Years"" (which he co-wrote). Bickler recorded new music with the band in hopes of a new album, but ongoing lawsuits and trademark ownership issues with former singer Jimi Jamison halted the release.          Bickler was fired in early 2000 after a brief string of tour dates. On April 1, 2000, it was announced that for the second time Singer Jimi Jamison was the new lead singer of Survivor.          Bickler is credited with co-writing two songs on the Survivor album ""Reach"" with Frankie Sullivan: ""I Don't"" and ""One More Chance"".          In 2013, it was announced on Survivor's official media sources that guitarist Frankie Sullivan had reunited the current Survivor line-up with Dave Bickler again, with the band planning to have their two most well-known vocalists together for the next tour, Dave Bickler and Jimi Jamison. Jamison died of a drug-induced stroke on August 31, 2014.          In March 2016 Bickler was again fired from Survivor.          Since 2000, Bickler has continued his venture in recording commercials and video advertisements. His singing is featured in the successful Budweiser Light ""Real American Heroes"" and ""Real Men of Genius"" ad campaign (the decision to change the campaign from Heroes to Genius was made after 9/11) singing plaintively in counterpoint to the wry commentary of voice actor Peter Stacker. Over 100 of these commercials have been recorded and broadcast on sports radio stations and events for over ten years. A handful of CDs from the Bud Light ads have been released and sold over 100,000 copies in its first three weeks of release. The release according to 'Pop Culture Tonight: with Patrick Phillips' February 2016 interview with Dave Bickler, sold 400,000 copies.","['1953 births', 'American rock singers', 'American male singer-songwriters', 'American singer-songwriters', 'American rock songwriters', 'American male songwriters', 'Living people', 'Survivor (band) members', 'People from Chappaqua, New York']"

44713,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44713,Everyman (play),"The Somonyng of Everyman (""The Summoning of Everyman""), usually referred to simply as ""Everyman"", is a late 15th-century morality play. Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel ""The Pilgrim's Progress"", ""Everyman"" uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.          The play was written in Middle English during the Tudor period, but the identity of the author is unknown. Although the play was apparently produced with some frequency in the seventy-five years following its composition, no production records survive.          There is a similar Dutch-language morality play of the same period called ""Elckerlijc"". In the early 20th century, scholars did not agree on which of these plays was the original, or even on their relation to a later Latin work named ""Homulus"". By the 1980s, Arthur Cawley went so far as to say that the ""evidence for … Elckerlijk is certainly very strong"", and now Davidson, Walsh, and Broos hold that ""more than a century of scholarly discussion has . . . convincingly shown that ""Everyman"" is a translation and adaptation from the Dutch ""Elckerlijc"""".          The cultural setting is based on the Roman Catholicism of the era. Everyman attains afterlife in heaven by means of good works and the Catholic Sacraments, in particular Confession, Penance, Unction, Viaticum and receiving the Eucharist.          The oldest surviving example of the script begins with this paragraph on the frontispiece:          After a brief prologue asking the audience to listen, God speaks, lamenting that humans have become too absorbed in material wealth and riches to follow Him, so he commands Death to go to Everyman and summon him to heaven to make his reckoning. Death arrives at Everyman's side to tell him it is time to die and face judgment. Upon hearing this, Everyman is distressed, so begs for more time. Death denies this, but will allow Everyman to find a companion for his journey.          Everyman's friend Fellowship promises to go anywhere with him, but when he hears of the true nature of Everyman's journey, he refuses to go. Everyman then calls on Kindred and Cousin and asks them to go with him, but they both refuse. In particular, Cousin explains a fundamental reason why no people will accompany Everyman: they have their own accounts to write as well. Afterwards, Everyman asks Goods, who will not come: God’s judgment will be severe because of the selfishness implied in Goods’s presence.          Everyman then turns to Good Deeds, who says she would go with him, but she is too weak as Everyman has not loved her in his life. Good Deeds summons her sister Knowledge to accompany them, and together they go to see Confession. In the presence of Confession, Everyman begs God for forgiveness and repents his sins, punishing himself with a scourge. After his scourging, Everyman is absolved of his sins, and as a result, Good Deeds becomes strong enough to accompany Everyman on his journey with Death.          Good Deeds then summons Beauty, Strength, Discretion and Five Wits to join them, and they agree to accompany Everyman as he goes to a priest to take sacrament. After the sacrament, Everyman tells them where his journey ends, and again they all abandon him – except for Good Deeds. Even Knowledge cannot accompany him after he leaves his physical body, but will stay with him until the time of death.          Content at last, Everyman climbs into his grave with Good Deeds at his side and dies, after which they ascend together into heaven, where they are welcomed by an Angel. The play closes as the Doctor enters and explains that in the end, a man will only have his Good Deeds to accompany him beyond the grave.          A modern stage production of ""Everyman"" did not appear until July 1901 when The Elizabethan Stage Society of William Poel gave three outdoor performances at the Charterhouse in London. Poel then partnered with British actor Ben Greet to produce the play throughout Britain, with runs on the American Broadway stage from 1902 to 1918, and concurrent tours throughout North America. These productions differed from past performances in that women were cast in the title role, rather than men. Film adaptations of the 1901 version of the play appeared in 1913 and 1914, with the 1913 film being presented with an early color two-process pioneered by Kinemacolor.          Another well-known version of the play is ""Jedermann"" by the Austrian playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which has been performed annually at the Salzburg Festival since 1920. The play was made into a film in 1961. Frederick Franck published a modernised version of the tale entitled ""Everyone"", drawing on Buddhist influence. A direct-to-video film of ""Everyman"" was made in 2002, directed by John Farrell, which updated the setting to the early 21st century, including Death as a businessman in dark glasses with a briefcase, and Goods being played by a talking personal computer.

756653,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=756653,Kopi Luwak,"Kopi luwak (), or civet coffee, refers to the coffee that includes part-digested coffee cherries eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (""Paradoxurus hermaphroditus"").          Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection and digestion. Selection occurs if the civets choose to eat cherries. Digestive mechanisms may improve the flavor profile of the coffee beans that have been eaten. The civet eats the cherries for the fleshy pulp, then in the digestive tract, fermentation occurs. The civet's protease enzymes seep into the beans, making shorter peptides and more free amino acids. Passing through a civet's intestines the cherries are then defecated with other fecal matter and collected.          The traditional method of collecting feces from wild civets has given way to intensive farming methods in which civets in battery cage systems are force fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets due to ""horrific conditions"" including isolation, poor diet, small cages and a high mortality rate. A 2013 BBC investigation of intensive civet farming in Sumatra found conditions of animal cruelty. Intensive farming is also criticised by traditional farmers because the civets do not select what they eat, so the cherries which are fed to them in order to flavor the coffee are of poor quality compared to those beans collected from the wild. According to an officer from the TRAFFIC conservation programme, the trade in civets to make kopi luwak may constitute a significant threat to wild civet populations.          Although kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world with retail prices reaching / per kilogram, close to the / price of Black Ivory coffee. The price paid to collectors in the Philippines is closer to US$20 per kilogram. The price of farmed (considered low-grade by connoisseurs) kopi luwak in large Indonesian supermarkets is from US$100 per kilogram (five times the price of a high quality local arabica coffee). Genuine kopi luwak from wild civets is difficult to purchase in Indonesia and proving it is not fake is very difficult – there is little enforcement regarding use of the name ""kopi luwak"", and there's even a local cheap coffee brand named ""Luwak"", which costs under US$3 per kilogram but is occasionally sold online under the guise of real kopi luwak.          An investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia found fraud to be rife in the kopi luwak industry, with producers willing to label coffee from caged civets with a ""wild sourced"" or similar label. A BBC investigation revealed similar findings.          Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in the farms in the islands of the Philippines (where the product is called ""kape motit"" in the Cordillera region, ""kapé alamíd"" in Tagalog areas, and ""kapé melô"" or ""kapé musang"" in Mindanao island), and in East Timor (where it is called ""kafé-laku""). ""Weasel coffee"" is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name ""cà phê Chồn"", where popular, chemically simulated versions are also produced.          The origin of kopi luwak is closely connected with the history of coffee production in Indonesia. In the early 18th century the Dutch established the cash-crop coffee plantations in their colony in the Dutch East Indies islands of Java and Sumatra, including Arabica coffee introduced from Yemen. During the era of ""Cultuurstelsel"" (1830–70), the Dutch prohibited the native farmers and plantation workers from picking coffee fruits for their own use. Still, the native farmers wanted to have a taste of the famed coffee beverage. Soon, the natives learned that certain species of ""musang"" or ""luwak"" (Asian palm civet) consumed the coffee fruits, yet they left the coffee seeds undigested in their droppings. The natives collected these luwaks' coffee seed droppings, then cleaned, roasted and ground them to make their own coffee beverage. The fame of aromatic civet coffee spread from locals to Dutch plantation owners and soon became their favourite, yet because of its rarity and unusual process, the civet coffee was expensive even during the colonial era.          Few objective assessments of taste are available. Kopi luwak is a name for any beans collected from the excrement of civets, hence the taste may vary with the type and origin of beans ingested, processing subsequent to collection, roasting, aging and brewing. The ability of the civet to select its berries, and other aspects of the civet's diet and health (e.g. stress levels) may also influence the processing and hence taste.          In the coffee industry, kopi luwak is widely regarded as a gimmick or novelty item. The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) states that there is a ""general consensus within the industry ... it just tastes bad"". A coffee professional cited in the SCAA article was able to compare the same beans with and without the kopi luwak process using a rigorous coffee cupping evaluation. He concluded: ""it was apparent that Luwak coffee sold for the story, not superior quality...Using the SCAA cupping scale, the Luwak scored two points below the lowest of the other three coffees. It would appear that the Luwak processing diminishes good acidity and flavor and adds smoothness to the body, which is what many people seem to note as a positive to the coffee.”          Tim Carman, food writer for the Washington Post reviewed kopi luwak available to US consumers and concluded ""It tasted just like...Folgers. Stale. Lifeless. Petrified dinosaur droppings steeped in bathtub water. I couldn't finish it.""          Some critics claim more generally that kopi luwak is simply bad coffee, purchased for novelty rather than taste. Massimo Marcone, who performed extensive chemical tests on the beans, was unable to conclude if anything about their properties made them superior for purposes of making coffee. He employed several professional coffee tasters (called ""cuppers"") in a blind taste test. While the cuppers were able to distinguish the kopi luwak as distinct from the other samples, they had nothing remarkable to appraise about it other than it was less acidic and had less body, tasting ""thin"". Marcone remarked ""It's not that people are after that distinct flavor. They are after the rarity of the coffee"".          ""Kopi"" is the Indonesian word for coffee. ""Luwak"" is a local name of the Asian palm civet in Sumatra. Palm civets are primarily frugivorous, feeding on berries and pulpy fruits such as figs and palms. Civets also eat small vertebrates, insects, ripe fruits and seeds.          Early production began when beans were gathered in the wild from where a civet would defecate as a means to mark its territory. On farms, civets are either caged or allowed to roam within defined boundaries.          Coffee berries are eaten by a civet for their fruit pulp. After spending about a day and a half in the civet's digestive tract the beans are then defecated in clumps, having kept their shape and still covered with some of the fleshy berry's inner layers.          Despite being in contact with faeces and pathogenic organisms, the beans contain negligible amounts of the enteric (pathogenic) organisms associated with feces. Moreover, the ""cherry"" or endocarp surrounding the bean is not completely digested by the luwak, and after being collected, the farmer performs thorough washing and removes the endocarp. The final roasting of the beans would, additionally, eliminate any remaining bacteria.          Sumatra is the world's largest regional producer of kopi luwak. Sumatran civet coffee beans are mostly an early arabica variety cultivated in the Indonesian archipelago since the 17th century. The major Sumatran kopi luwak production area is in Lampung, Bengkulu and Aceh especially the Gayo region, Takengon. Tagalog kape alamid comes from civets fed on a mixture of coffee beans and is sold in the Batangas region along with gift shops near airports in the Philippines.          Vietnam has two farms with 300 wild civets in Dak Lak, while in Mindanao island of the Philippines, has two farms with 200 (in Davao City) and 100 (in Cagayan de Oro City) wild civets. But the archipelago of Indonesia where the famous ""kopi luwak"" was first discovered and produced is leading in supplying the world market for almost three centuries, where many small-scale civet farms are proliferating in the countryside.          Several studies have examined the process in which the animal's stomach acids and enzymes digest the beans' covering and ferment the beans. Research by food scientist Massimo Marcone at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada showed that the civet's endogenous digestive secretions seep into the beans. These secretions carry proteolytic enzymes which break down the beans' proteins, yielding shorter peptides and more free amino acids. The proteins are also involved in non-enzymatic Maillard browning reactions brought about later by roasting. Moreover, while inside a civet the beans begin to germinate by malting which also lowers their bitterness. Marcone also conducted an analysis on the volatile compounds which are responsible for the coffee's flavour and aroma, showing that there are significant differences from regular coffee. He concluded that:           According to Dr. Davila Cortes, the altered protein structure degrades the effectiveness of the coffee as a diuretic.          Several commercial processes attempt to replicate the digestive process of the civets without animal involvement.          Researchers with the University of Florida have been issued with a patent for one such process. According to the patent application, sensory tests were conducted and verified a significant reduction in bitterness. This technology was licensed to Coffee Primero.          Vietnamese companies also claim to have replicated the digestive process with an enzyme soak.          Imitation has several motivations. The high price of kopi luwak drives the search for a way to produce kopi luwak in large quantities. Kopi luwak production involves a great deal of labour, whether farmed or wild-gathered. The small production quantity and the labor involved in production contribute to the coffee's high cost. Imitation may be a response to the decrease in the civet population.          Initially, civet coffee beans were picked from wild civet excrement found around coffee plantations. This unusual process contributed to its rarity and subsequently, its high price. More recently, growing numbers of intensive civet ""farms"" have been established and operated across Southeast Asia, confining tens of thousands of animals to live in battery cages and be force-fed. Concerns were raised over the safety of civet coffee after evidence suggested that the SARS virus originated from palm civets.          '""The conditions are awful, much like battery chickens"", said Chris Shepherd, deputy regional director of the conservation NGO, TRAFFIC south-east Asia. ""The civets are taken from the wild and have to endure horrific conditions. They fight to stay together but they are separated and have to bear a very poor diet in very small cages. There is a high mortality rate and for some species of civet, there's a real conservation risk. It's spiralling out of control. But there's not much public awareness of how it's actually made. People need to be aware that tens of thousands of civets are being kept in these conditions. It would put people off their coffee if they knew""'.          A 2013 investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia found wild-caught civets on farms in Indonesia and the Philippines. The animals were deprived of exercise, a proper diet, and space. Video footage from the investigation shows abnormal behaviours such as repeated pacing, circling, or biting the bars of their cages. The animals often lose their fur.          Tony Wild, the coffee executive responsible for bringing kopi luwak to the Western world, has stated he no longer supports using kopi luwak due to animal cruelty and launched a campaign called ""Cut the Crap"" to halt the use of kopi luwak.          Farmers using caged civets in Takengon, north Sumatra, confirmed to the BBC that they supplied kopi luwak beans to exporters whose produce ends up in Europe and Asia.          Kopi luwak is one of the most expensive coffees in the world, selling for between US$100 and $600 per pound in 2010. The specialty Vietnamese ""weasel coffee"", which is made by collecting coffee beans eaten by wild civets, is sold at US$3,000 per kilogram. Most customers are Asian, especially those originating from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Sources vary widely as to annual worldwide production.          The price paid to collectors in the Philippines is closer to US$20 per kilogram.          Some specialty coffee shops sell cups of brewed kopi luwak for US$35–$80. Some coffee shops in Jakarta serve kopi luwak for US$6–10.          There are reports of a kopi luwak type process occurring naturally with muntjac and birds.          In 1995, an Ig Nobel Prize was awarded to John Martinez of J. Martinez & Company in Atlanta, Georgia, for ""Luak Coffee, the world's most expensive coffee, which is made from coffee beans ingested and excreted by the luak (aka, the palm civet), a bobcat-like animal native to Indonesia.""          Kopi Luwak is also mentioned in ""The Bucket List"" (2008) as Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) reveals with great amusement of how the Kopi Luwak — enjoyed by Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) — was produced; eaten and defecated by a jungle cat. Cole reacted in surprise ""You're shitting me!"" and Carter replied in jest ""Cats beat me to it!"".          Kopi Luwak coffee makes an appearance in History Channel's reality TV series, ""Pawn Stars"" (18 July 2013), with several characters refusing to drink it after learning how it is made.          In ""Franklin and Bash"", Season 3 Episode 9, ""Shoot to Thrill"", associate lawyer/germaphobe Pinder and his law partner Stanton Infeld each drink Kopi Luwak. After Pinder learns of the coffee's origin he begins to vomit due to his extreme germaphobia.          In Season 3 of Jerry Seinfeld's web series, ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"", Jerry and his guest, Jay Leno, both partake in a $75 cup of ""cat shit coffee."" Leno proceeds to say it is awful. Jerry drinks his own coffee and later finishes Leno's, at which point it appears Leno has ordered a Coke.","['Animal waste products', 'Animal welfare', 'Coffee preparation', 'Cruelty to animals', 'Feces', 'Indonesian beverages', 'Indonesian words and phrases']"

The Nanjing National Theatre Academy was founded in the fall of 1935 by Fang Chih as an organ of the KMT Central Propaganda Department. Fang, working on behalf of the CC Clique, a powerful faction of the Kuomintang, envisioned the school as China's first ever institute of higher education in the field of drama espousing the principals of the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement was the brainchild of General Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling with the backing of the Blue Shirts Society, the KMT's extreme right wing.          The original campus was located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Sanyong Lane (zh: 双龙巷) and Nanjing Gulu (zh: 南京鼓楼).          With the outbreak of World War Two, the school moved briefly to Changsha and then to Chungking. In 1938 or 1939, the school moved to Jiang Country, Sichuan Province. In 1940, the name of the school was changed to the ""National Theatre College"" (zh: 国立戏剧专科学校) as a branch of the Ministry of Education where Fang Chih was the Chairman of the Transitional National Government Committee. In 1945, the school again relocated briefly to Chungking where Fang was the municipality's party chief before being relocated permanently to Nanking.          After the fall of the Kuomintang government in the Chinese Civil War, the Nanjing Theatre Academy merged with the drama department of the ""Lu Xun Art Academy"" to form the ""Central Academy of Drama"" (zh: 中央戏剧学院) by order of Mao Zedong. Today, the ""Central Academy of Drama"" is one of the most prestigious drama school in the PRC together with the Beijing Film Academy and the Shanghai Theatre Academy. The school was relocated to Beijing in April 1950 where it was renamed under the Central Academy of Drama with Ouyang Yuqian acting as the first school president.","['Universities and colleges in Beijing', 'Film schools in China', 'Drama schools in China', 'Educational institutions established in 1935', '1935 establishments in China']"

Currently, it is part of Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall. Henderson Hall is named for Brevet Brigadier General Archibald Henderson, the fifth and longest-serving Commandant of the Marine Corps.          Most of the land occupied by Henderson Hall was originally owned by the Syphax family. Maria Custis Syphax, the matriarch of the family, was the mulatto daughter of George Washington Parke Custis, grandson of Martha Washington and founder of the Arlington Estate on the banks of the Potomac River (later the home of Robert E. Lee). The Spyhax family sold the land to John Dormoyle in 1901, who then sold it to Frederick Rice in 1924.          Much of the rest of the land beneath Henderson Hall was part of the Arlington Estate as well. In 1941, the federal government built a temporary warehouse on this land, calling Federal Office Building No. 2. It quickly was converted into office space for use by the U.S. Navy, and informally renamed the Navy Annex.          The USMC headquarters moved to the Navy Annex in November 1941. A Headquarters and Service Company was organized on March 1, 1942, and a Women Marine Company (part of the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve) organized as part of the Headquarters unit on April 1, 1943. To house both companies, the Marine Corps began acquiring, through purchase, easement, eminent domain, and other means, property to the west and northwest of the Navy Annex Building. This included most of the Syphax land, except for that already purchased by Abbey Mausoleum. Henderson Hall was built on this property in September 1943 to house both companies. All told, were acquired, and athletic fields, a bowling alley, chapel, firing range, gas station, gym, hobby shop, officers' and enlisted men's clubs, post exchange, post office, radio station, supply depot, and swimming pool were all built on the site.          The Women's Reserve was released from active duty in August 1946, and the women's barracks at Henderson Hall renovated into billeting space for male Marines.          Land acquisition ended in 1952, and on February 1, 1954, the Commonwealth of Virginia executed a document ceding political jurisdiction over the land to the U.S. federal government.          Covering of land, Henderson Hall is home to the USMC headquarters company unit and associated educational facilities. Since 2005, Henderson Hall is jointly managed by the Marine Corps and Fort Myer as a Myer–Henderson Hall.          Little at Henderson Hall is historic. All 19th and early 20th century buildings were demolished during its construction, and grading and construction at the site have destroyed whatever archeological artifacts might have existed.

There are regular buses to Dover and Canterbury which is about 13 miles away, there is also a railway station 3 miles away at the nearby village of Shepherdswell where trains operate between Dover and London to both St Pancras and Victoria stations via Canterbury.          ""Eythorne Baptist Church"" is more than 450 years old and one of the first Baptist churches in the UK. Esther Copley, wife of William Copley, who was minister in Eythorne from about 1839 to 1843, was a prolific and successful writer of children's books and books on domestic economy. She died in the village in 1851.          The village is on the East Kent Railway, a heritage railway.          Eythorne once had three pubs, The Crown is still trading, however the White Horse and the Palm Tree are long closed, both now being residential properties.          Eythorne is in historically set in two halves, Lower Eythorne where the Church of England and Roman Catholic churches are situated, and Upper Eythorne which is where the village shop and the Crown public house are located, this is also where most of today's villagers live. Many reside in the small housing developments that sprang up in the late 1960s and early 1970s.          Eythorne is in the electoral ward called Eythorne and Shepherdswell. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 4,815.          Eythorne has only one shop, a post office newsagent with a few general goods. In 1960, Chapel Hill had a double fronted Co-op store, a haberdashery, bicycle shop, greengrocery, and another food shop. At its junction with Sandwich Road was a separate newsagent, opposite the post office. A little further, along a garage, owned for many years by the Hampshire family (who also owned the Post Office together with the one in Elvington, the mining village a mile to the north). It sold petrol until around 1980. The current hairdresser is relatively recent, having been opened only about 30 years. Before this, the village chemist was in the same place (Last pharmacist Mrs Crossland). Further along Sandwich Road was the bakery (Last baker, Mr Clayton). The old bake house still exists. Immediately next door was the old Eythorne School, for all ages to 14, which closed during the war due to the Butler Education Act. This then became a factory until demolition in the 1970s for housing. Next to this was an old green building, which for most of the time after WW2 housed Hampshire's coaches, but its deep dug out floor would have shown its earlier use as the Eythorne Cinema. This also fell to housing in the 1970s. A little further still, on the opposite side was Eythorne Haulage Yard, previously a coal yard, this went to housing shortly after.          Nor was this the end of Eythornes' shopping delights! A Mrs Simmonds ran a tiny sweet and food store in the ancient building opposite side of Church Hill to the White Horse, and a Spar shop and Butchers were situated near to the Crown Pub. All these operated through the early 1960s closing one by one into the 1970s. Even unmade New Road had a shop purpose built in its short terrace of early Edwardian housing, closed for many years it reopened in the late 1960s, trading into the seventies before closing again (Mrs Bryson)          A hairdresser existed at the village centre roundabout, together with the Cafe, a centre for 'ton up' boys on motorcycles in the 1950s and early 1960s (Mr G Townshend). A Mr Mears ran a builders' yard between the cafe and the Crown, and opposite the Crown was a forge. Down at the Junction of Green Lane and Monkton Court Lane was a food canning factory which was just along the footpath, to the East of the quaint cottages. The village doctor (Bellamy) worked from his home in Coldred Road.          Farm industry existed in Eythorne Court farm, and a further farm along the footpath from Chapel Hill which runs west parallel to railway. Much of the 1960s these were run by the Ledger family. Bill Davis ran a small holding in New Road in the 1950s, taken over by his son in law and grandson, Eddie and Ted Watson, who produced free-range eggs on a considerable scale. There was also an old farmyard in Green Lane, which was derelict in the 1950s and went to housing in the 1960s.          Eythorne also had a rhubarb canning factory which was in operation until after the war. Also a blacksmith's opposite the Crown in the buildings fell into disuse and were redeveloped in the 1980s. Along the Colred Road was the site of the original Baptist church until the late 19th century, when it was moved to Chapel Hill due to a neighbour complaining about being woken up on Sunday with loud hymn singing. That neighbour bought the land for the chapel, which is still being used till this day. The nearby woods along the Coldred Road is named locally as Thommies Hole and was used as a training ground during the war. Some of the trenches dug can still be made out. There was also a narrow-gauge railway line, and that is now used as a footpath (although largely overgrown); you can still see some of the sleepers in place.","['Villages in Kent', 'Civil parishes in Kent']"

23599278,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23599278,Marcus de Laune Faunce,"Marcus de Laune ""Marc"" Faunce, CVO, AM, OBE, FRCP, FRACP (5 December 1922 – 14 June 2004) was a Canberra consultant physician, head of Royal Canberra Hospital, doctor to five Australian Prime Ministers and six Governors-General of Australia and former Senior Physician Consultant to the RAAF.          Faunce was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide. After obtaining his medical qualifications from Adelaide University in 1946 (winning first place in Anatomy and Physiology 1943) he served in the Australian Army Medical Corps as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in post-war Japan, near Hiroshima. Upon discharge he sailed to England and studied at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital. He became Senior Registrar at Sydney Hospital in 1949 and married in 1951 Marjorie Morison, a journalist with the Sydney Morning Herald, who died in 1995. From 1954 until 1956 Faunce attained further postgraduate skills in respiratory medicine at the Brompton Hospital in London and later obtained Fellowships of the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. In 1966 he was elected a Fellow of the American College of Chest Physicians (being sponsored by Sir Harry Wunderly and Dr Hilary Roche). Faunce and his wife Marjorie moved to Canberra in 1957, where Faunce soon established himself as a consultant physician in private practise and as a part-time salaried specialist with the Commonwealth anti-tuberculosis campaign.          During his 35 years in full-time practice, Faunce became recognised for his diagnostic skills, for his high standards of professional ethics and his concern for the medical, personal and social needs of his patients.           Trainee Bill Burke (now a Canberra respiratory physician) stated: ""Ebullient, military in his gait and bearing, [Faunce] was prone to swing onto the ward stepping out to his own loudly-whistled accompaniment of the Colonel Bogey march. He was knowledgeable yet always looking to expand his knowledge, and his visits to the patient's bedside in even the most dire circumstances had a therapeutic effect seldom available in the pharmacopoeia.""          Faunce was individually selected to be honorary personal physician to five Prime Ministers (including Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser) and six Governors-General (including Sir Zelman Cowen, Sir Ninian Stephen, and The Hon. Bill Hayden). Faunce was Prime Minister Harold Holt's personal physician at the time of the latter's disappearance in the surf at Portsea; his treatment at that time of Holt's shoulder injury and refusal to prescribe opiates featured in the 2008 film ""The Prime Minister is Missing"".          In 1959, Faunce and fellow physician Tony Proust founded the Canberra Medical Society, whose meetings were initially held in the Howard Florey lecture theatre of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, through the courtesy of its Director. Marc served on the ACT Medical Board from 1963–74 and was Senior Physician Consultant to the RAAF Medical Directorate from 1976–1980 with the rank of Group Captain.           Faunce was largely responsible for the creation of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at the Royal Canberra Hospital in 1978. He had a great affection for the old Royal Canberra Hospital on the Acton Peninsula, serving on its Board of Management from 1967–74. Marc protested against its demolition and he was appointed Emeritus Consultant upon its closure in 1993. Faunce was an inspiring teacher and had long been a staunch advocate for a Medical School at the Australian National University. Marc had a close friendship with Professor Frank Fenner and was highly respected in the Canberra medical community.          For his service to Australian Prime Ministers and Governors General Faunce was awarded the Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1995.

It is part of the Nandewar Range and has been preserved within the Mount Kaputar National Park. The mountain is a prominent landmark for travellers on the Newell Highway as it rises abruptly from the plains. It is claimed that on a clear day roughly one seventh of New South Wales is visible from the top of the mountain. In the cold of winter the mountain may receive a light dusting of snow.          The summit is accessible from Narrabri via a long, winding and narrow road that is partly sealed. Neighbouring Mount Dowe, with an elevation of above sea level, contains various telecommunications broadcasting equipment and the large antenna is visible from the Kamilaroi Highway heading south towards Gunnedah.          There is a lookout at the top of the peak called Mount Kaputar Lookout. Nearby is the Governor Lookout and Eckfords Lookout as well as Dawson Spring with cabins, picnic tables and camping facilities.          Mount Kaputar is the remnants of an extinct volcano that was active about 18 million years ago. Mount Lindesay was probably the centre of the volcano. The predominant vegetation on the mountain is dry sclerophyll forest.          The main vegetation types are dry rainforests, dry eucalypt forests and heathlands. A sub-alpine zone known as the Kaputar Plateau forms an elevate area above sea level. Here the main vegetation type is open eucalypt forest dominated by snow gum, ribbon gum and mountain gum. Below this down to above sea level the most common trees include the silver-top stringybark and rough-barked mountain gum. Heath occurs in scattered patches where exposure to high winds and shallow soils inhibits the growth of larger trees.          The mountain is home to a giant, fluorescent pink slug, which can grow up to in length. This pink subspecies of the red triangle slug is found only on this single mountaintop. The peak is an isolated habitat island on which endemic invertebrates and plant species have existed for millions of years. According to a park ranger there are three species of cannibal snails on the mountain.","['Mountains of New South Wales', 'Volcanoes of New South Wales', 'Extinct volcanoes', 'Miocene volcanism', 'North West Slopes']"

It lies on the west bank of the Yapacani River, at the mouth of the Surutú River, 100 km north-west of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the largest city in Bolivia. It is the centre of the district of Yapacaní Municipio. Prior to its foundation on 23 August 1953, there was a military post called El Comando.           In the last two decades the town's population has risen from 8,585 inhabitants ""(census 1992)"", to 14,665 ""(census 2001)"", to 26,270 inhabitants ""(2012 estimate)"".          Transportation          The town has a four lane road through its center, which was re-surfaced and stop lights were installed in 2010. Transportation in Yapacani is dominated by motorcycles, truffies, and Micro-buses. Motorcycle taxis operate the streets of the town allowing one to arrive from one place to another for about 2 Bolivianos. Travel between towns is usually done in truffies which are cars operated by collectives. A trip to Santa Cruz is 20 Bolivianos, to Montero 10 Bolivianos, Santa Fe 2 Bolivianos, San Juan de Yapacani 4 Bolivianos, and Bulo Bulo 11 Bolivianos. One bus leaves from Yapacani direct to Cochabamba.           Economy          The small villages surrounding Yapacani produce rice, cane sugar, manderine oranges, and other products. Rice is by far the largest crop produced and provides income to many small communities that lie to the north of town. These communities are accessed by a road called ""Faja Norte"" where a two Boliviano fee is charged to enter. This road makes a loop from Yapacani north-west later re-joining the main Santa Cruz-Cochabamba road near the community of Ichilo. The road is almost entirely gravel and sometimes becomes difficult to navigate in the rainy season. The towns along the Faja Norte that produce rice from nearest to farthest from Yapacani are: Km 7,Villa Imperial (Km 23), El Comandito (Km 35), Km 48, Challavito, and Cascabel.

The name Guararapes is a reference to the Guararapes Battle, fought in the surrounding area. Since 27 December 2001, the airport has been named after Gilberto Freyre (1900–1987), a renowned sociologist who was born in Recife.          It is operated by Infraero.          Some of its facilities are shared with the Recife Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force.          Originally called ""Ibura Airport"", the airport had its name changed to Guararapes Airport in 1948. The facility originated at the time of World War II, when a new airport was built to replace the earlier airfield, ""Parque do Encanta Moça"". With the end of the War, the facility became strategically important as a technical and refueling stop on the route from South America to Europe.          On 18 January 1958, a new passenger terminal was inaugurated, replacing the original facility. During this time, runway 14/32 was extended from 1,800 m (5,906 ft) to 2,010 m (6,594 ft), and runway 18/36 was extended from 1,800 m to 2,400 m (7,874 ft).          In 1979, an agreement with Infraero was made in order to further develop the airport complex. The passenger terminal underwent its first major renovation in 1982 and another enlargement in 1990.          In 2004 a brand-new passenger terminal was built, including a new shopping mall, thus generating more traffic and revenue. Furthermore, a new concourse was opened in 2004 and the airport's capacity increased from 1.5 to 9 million passengers/year. Today, the runway is 3,300 meters (10,827 ft) long, the longest in Northeastern Brazil.          On 31 August 2009 Infraero unveiled a BRL 8.75 million (USD 4.6 million; EUR 3.2 million) investiment plan to upgrade Guararapes International Airport, focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Recife being one of the venue cities. The investment was spent in finishing the passenger terminal renovation, installing 8 more jetways. The work was completed on 1 July 2011, and the airport is now considered ready for the FIFA Cup.          The Brazilian Integrated Air Traffic Control and Air Defense Center, section 3 (Cindacta III) is located in the vicinity of the airport.          The airport is located from downtown Recife, from Boa Viagem Beach, and from Suape port.","['Airports in Pernambuco', 'Buildings and structures in Recife', 'Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command on the South Atlantic Route']"
20446105,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20446105,Marine Optical Buoy,"The Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) measures light at and very near the sea surface in a specific location over a long period of time, serving as part of an ocean color observation system. Satellites are another component of the system, providing global coverage through remote sensing; however, satellites measure light above the Earth's atmosphere, becoming subject to interference from the atmosphere itself and other light sources. The Marine Optical Buoy helps alleviate that interference and thus improve the quality of the overall ocean color observation system.          MOBY is a buoy 15 meters tall floating vertically in the water with approximately 3 meters above the surface and 12 meters below. A float canister is at water level, measuring approximately 2 meters high and 1.5 meters in diameter above the water, 1 meter in diameter below the water. Above the float canister are four solar panels and an antenna column. From the bottom of the float canister, a central column descends to a 2-meter-high, 1-meter-diameter instrument canister. Along the central column are three standoff arms measuring 3 meters long, 2.5 meters long, and 2 meters long, respectively. The standoff arms can be relocated up and down the central column during maintenance. Light collectors are at the ends of the standoff arms and at the top of the antenna column. The antenna column includes Global Positioning System (GPS), very high frequency (VHF), and cellular telephone antennas. Computers, communications, and control electronics occupy the float canister. A marine optical system (MOS), a power system, and batteries occupy the instrument canister. The MOS includes spectrographs with charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors, an optical multiplexer, and fiber optic sensor lines to the light collectors.          MOBY has a tether to another buoy that is moored to the sea floor at a depth of about 1200 meters. MOBY is located at , west of Lanai, in the lee of the Hawaiian Islands.          Light from the Sun crosses space, enters and travels through the Earth's atmosphere, then enters the Earth's oceans. In the atmosphere and in the oceans, this light reflects from, refracts around, and absorbs into molecules and other objects. Some of this light leaves the water to again travel through the atmosphere and out into space, carrying the color of whatever it struck.          At the sea surface, light coming down through the atmosphere enters the collector at the top of MOBY's antenna column. Each of MOBY's three submerged standoff arms has a pair of light collectors: one on top of the arm to collect downward moving light; and one underneath the arm to collect upward moving reflected light. Light entering the collectors travels through optical fibers and the optical multiplexer to the CCD detectors and spectrographs. The spectrographs record the light signals, and a computer stores the measurement data. The communications system aboard MOBY daily transmits much of the light measurement data to operators on shore.          There is one Marine Optical Buoy operating in the water, and another in maintenance on shore. Every 3 to 4 months, a team exchanges the two buoys. The team calibrates each MOBY while it is in maintenance, both before deploying the buoy and after recovering it. Additionally, a team visits the MOBY in the water monthly, to clean algae, barnacles, and other organisms off the light collectors; and to generate independent comparison data using portable reference light sources. Each MOBY has internal reference light sources, as well, for continuous but not independent comparison. The MOBY calibration data traces to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) radiometric standards directly, as opposed to using intermediate standards.          MOBY has generated calibrated measurements of ocean color at the sea surface since 1996. MOBY served as the primary sea surface calibration for satellite borne sensors such as the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MOBY has contributed to the calibration of the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS), the Polarization Detection Environmental Radiometer (POLDER), and the Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (IRS1-MOS).          Long term sensors on the sea surface, such as MOBY, help improve the quality of the global ocean color observation system.","['Satellite meteorology and remote sensing', 'Oceanographic instrumentation', 'Physical oceanography', 'Radiometry']"

9889145,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9889145,Vagal tone,"Vagal tone is an internal biological process referring to the activity of the vagus nerve, the tenth cranial nerve located in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The vagus nerve serves as the key component of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, regulating the homeostasis (or ""resting state"") of the majority of the body's internal organ systems that operate on a largely subconscious level, such as the heart, lungs, eyes, glands and digestive tract. Due to the regulatory nature of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), vagal activity is continuous, chronic, and passive (""tone"" in this usage is analogous to ""tension"").          In the context of psychophysiological research, vagal tone (and specifically its influence on heart rate) represents an index for the functional state of the entire parasympathetic nervous system. Heart rate is normally controlled by multiple centers in the brainstem; one of these centers, the nucleus ambiguus, increases parasympathetic nervous system input to the heart via the vagus nerve. Vagal tone decreases heart rate by inhibiting the firing rate of the sinoatrial node (S-A node, the ""pace-maker"" tissue of the heart). The absolute level of cardiac vagal activity or vagal tone appears to result from the excitatory drive from peripheral baroreceptors. In animals, cardiac vagal activity disappears at very low pressures or if the afferent nerves are cut. Thus, a major determinant of resting heart rate is the beat to beat activation of the arterial baroreflex with each cardiac cycle.          Cardiac vagal tone has been treated as a physiologic substrate of regulation of emotion and arousal.          Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a naturally occurring variation in heart rate that occurs during a breathing cycle. RSA is also a measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity – which denotes ""rest and digest"" behaviors.          Vagal tone cannot be directly measured. Instead, other biological processes are measured that represent the functionality of vagal tone. An increase in vagal tone both slows the heart and makes heart rate more variable (i.e. there is more beat-to-beat change between heart beats). During the process of RSA inhalation temporarily suppresses vagal activity, causing an immediate increase in heart rate. Exhalation then decreases heart rate as it causes vagal activity to resume. Thus, while vagal tone is not explicitly measured, the resultant changes in heart rate are. This is done by measuring periodic changes in the heart rate during a resting state of cardiovascular activity, a process known as heart rate variability (HRV). There are about 40 published methods of quantifying HRV, but the vast majority of studies use only a few of the available measurements. Most common is high-frequency HRV, a measurement of the amount of heart rate variability there is between typical breathing cycles (approximately 2.5 to 6.7 seconds).          On an electrocardiogram ECG, RSA is seen as subtle changes in the R-R interval (time between two of the distinctive, large, upward ""R"" spikes on an electrocardiogram) synchronized with respiration. The R-R interval on an ECG is shortened during inhalation and prolonged during expiration. Meditation and relaxed breathing techniques can temporarily alter RSA.          RSA is very pronounced in children, but without sufficient cardiovascular exercise it gradually disappears as a person approaches his/her teenage years. Typically, expression of RSA decreases with age; however, adults in excellent cardiovascular health, such as endurance runners, swimmers, and cyclists, are likely to have a more pronounced RSA. Professional athletes typically maintain very high vagal tone and RSA levels. RSA also becomes less prominent in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.          Studies have shown that the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange is improved by RSA, suggesting that RSA may play an active physiological role. The matched timing of alveolar ventilation and its perfusion with RSA within each respiratory cycle could save energy expenditure by suppressing unnecessary heartbeats during expiration and ineffective ventilation during the ebb of perfusion (delivery of blood from arteries to capillaries for oxygenation and nutrition).          RSA or heart rate variability in synchrony with respiration is a biological phenomenon, which may have a positive influence on gas exchange at the level of the lung via efficient ventilation/perfusion matching.          Historically, respiratory sinus arrhythmia was believed to be pathological, and extended bed rest was traditionally prescribed until work by Sir James Mackenzie disproved this idea.          Due to age differences in expression of RSA, the majority of vagal tone research as it relates to social behavior and human psychology has focused on children. Typically, researchers are concerned with baseline vagal tone, treating it either as a potential predictor of behavior or examining its relationship with mental health (particularly emotion regulation, MDD, anxiety, and internalizing and externalizing disorders).          Research indicates that children with more secure attachments with their mothers exhibited greater empathetic responsiveness, less social inhibition, and higher vagal tone, again highlighting the vagus nerve's regulatory effect on emotional and social function.",['Cardiac electrophysiology']

5653999,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5653999,Peg DHCP,"Peg DHCP is a method defined in RFC 2322 to assign IP addresses in a context where regular DHCP wouldn't work. The ""server"" hands out wooden clothes-pegs numbered with the addresses to allocate and an additional leaflet with network information. The ""client"", typically the user, then configures their device accordingly.          Even though this RFC, ""Management of IP numbers by peg-dhcp"" was published on the first of April 1998, it describes, unlike most other April Fools' Day RFCs, a regularly used protocol with a serious purpose. During the preparation of Hacking in Progress 1997, the organizers were looking for a robust way to assign IP addresses to the participants. The obvious first choice, DHCP, almost completely defenseless against rogue servers, was not retained considering the traditionally creative use of the network.          Instead, for every address to allocate, the variable (host) part is written on a wooden peg with waterproof marker. The user would then attach it to the cable connecting that device to the network. The peg is accompanied by a leaflet with further information such as the static (net) part of the IP address, the netmask, the default gateway, DNS servers, and often also their MAC addresses to prevent ARP spoofing. Different subnets, such as LAN and WLAN are distinguished by different colors used to write on the pegs.          Peg DHCP was successfully used on Hacking in Progress '97 and the following events in the Netherlands, including the 2009 event Hacking at Random. The German Chaos Computer Club used it during its Chaos Communication Camps and is still using it in some editions of the Chaos Communication Congress.          At Hacking at Random, the pegs were distributed according to the network map of the event terrain. Every field had a distinct subnet and per subnet, there was a division between regular IP address distribution via DHCP and the (fixed) IP addresses, distributed via Peg DHCP. To obtain an IP address via Peg DHCP, one had to note the subnet number on their field's Datenklo (""dedicated rain-proof box for networking equipment"", usually an empty, portable toilet). With this subnet number, the correct, routable, IP address could be handed out.","['Internet Standards', 'Internet protocols', 'Hacking (computer security)', 'Hacker (subculture)']"

1146293,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1146293,Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force,"The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF) was a small volunteer force of approximately 2,000 men, raised in Australia shortly after the outbreak of the First World War to seize and destroy German wireless stations in German New Guinea in the south-west Pacific. Britain required the German wireless installations to be destroyed because they were used by Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee's German East Asian Cruiser Squadron, which threatened merchant shipping in the region. Following the capture of German possessions in the region, the AN&MEF provided occupation forces for the duration of the war. New Zealand provided a similar force for the occupation of German Samoa.          The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF) began forming following a request by the British government on 6 August 1914. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru and at Rabaul, New Britain. The force was assembled under the guidance of Colonel James Legge, and was separate from the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) forming under Major General William Bridges. The AN&MEF comprised one battalion of infantry of 1,000 men enlisted in Sydney, plus 500 naval reservists and ex-sailors who would serve as infantry. The 1st Battalion, AN&MEF was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment, which had been hurriedly dispatched to garrison Thursday Island, also contributed 500 volunteers to the force. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the very few of the infantry having had previous military experience.          Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the AN&MEF departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS ""Berrima"" and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until the New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser , cruiser , and the French cruiser ""Montcalm"", occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN&MEF then moved to Port Moresby where it met the Queensland contingent aboard the transport TSS ""Kanowna"". The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September but the ""Kanowna"" was left behind when her stokers refused to work. The soldiers from the Kennedy Regiment were also left in Port Moresby as Holmes felt that they were not trained or equipped well enough to be committed to the fighting that was expected.          Off the eastern tip of New Guinea, the ""Berrima"" rendezvoused with ""Australia"" and the light cruiser plus some destroyers. ""Melbourne"" had been detached to destroy the wireless station on Nauru. The task force reached Rabaul on 11 September, finding the port free of German forces. ""Sydney"" and the destroyer landed small parties of naval reservists at the settlements of Kabakaul and the German gubernatorial capital Herbertshöhe on Neu-Pommern, south-east of Rabaul. These parties were reinforced firstly by sailors from ""Warrego"" and later by infantry from ""Berrima"". A small 25-man force of naval reservists was subsequently landed at Kabakaul Bay and proceeded inland to capture the radio station believed to be in operation at Bita Paka, to the south.          The Australians were resisted by a mixed force of German reservists and Melanesian native police, who forced them to fight their way to the objective. By nightfall the radio station was reached, and it was found to have been abandoned. The mast had been dropped but its instruments and machinery were still intact. During the fighting at Bita Paka seven Australians were killed and five wounded, while the defenders lost one German NCO and about 30 Melanesians killed, and one German and 10 Melanesians wounded. Later it was alleged that the heavy losses among the Melanesian troops was the result of the Australians bayoneting all those they had captured during the fighting. As a result of this engagement Seaman W.G.V. Williams became the first Australian fatality of the war.          At nightfall on 12 September, ""Berrima"" landed the AN&MEF infantry battalion at Rabaul. The following afternoon, despite the fact that the German governor had not surrendered the territory, a ceremony was carried out to signal the British occupation of New Britain. The German administration had withdrawn inland to Toma and at dawn on 14 September, bombarded a ridge near the town, while half a battalion advanced towards the town, supported by a field gun.          The show of Australian firepower was sufficient to start negotiations, ending the Siege of Toma. Terms were signed on 17 September and all military resistance ceased, with the remaining 40 German soldiers and 110 natives surrendering on 21 September. The German colony at Madang on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (the New Guinea mainland) was occupied on 24 September but the German auxiliary cruiser SMS ""Cormoran"", which was lurking nearby, escaped undetected. Over the next two months the remaining outposts were occupied. The terms of the surrender allowed the colony's governor, Dr Eduard Haber, to return to Germany while German civilians were allowed to remain as long as they swore an oath of neutrality. Those who refused were transported to Australia from where they could freely travel back to Germany.          Although successful the operation was not well managed, and the Australians had been effectively delayed by a half-trained force. Regardless, the Australians had prevailed not least of all because of their unexpected ability to fight close terrain, while the outflanking of the German positions had unnerved their opponents. The losses of the AN&MEF were light in the context of later operations but were sufficiently heavy given the relatively modest gain. These losses were further compounded by the disappearance of the Australian submarine during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September, with 35 men aboard.          Following the capture of German possessions in the region, the AN&MEF provided occupation forces for the duration of the war. A military government was subsequently set up by Holmes. On 9 January 1915, Holmes handed over command of the AN&MEF to Brigadier General Sir Samuel Pethebridge, the former Secretary of the Department of Defence. Holmes returned to Australia in early 1915 and re-enlisted in the AIF, as did most of his men. Many later served in Egypt, Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine and on the Western Front. A large number became casualties, including Holmes, who was killed in action in 1917. They were replaced by the 3rd Battalion, AN&MEF, which was known as the ""Tropical Force"" because it had been specially enlisted for service in the tropics. The size of the garrison at this time was set at a total of 600 men.          Following the end of hostilities in November 1918 the role of the AN&MEF in the former German colonies in New Guinea had become primarily one of civil administration, although it continued to provide a garrison for the next two and a half years. The military government continued until 1921 when Australia received a mandate from the League of Nations to govern the territory. Although the AN&MEF had seen no further action following the initial seizure of the colony, in the years that followed the climate and a range of tropical diseases, such as malaria, had resulted in dozens of fatalities before the deployment concluded. A total of 3,011 men served in the AN&MEF. Although interrupted by Japanese occupation between 1942–45, Australian administration lasted until 1975 when Papua New Guinea gained its independence.","['Ad hoc units and formations of Australia', 'Expeditionary units and formations', 'Military units and formations of Australia in World War I', 'Military units and formations established in 1914', 'Military units and formations disestablished in 1921']"

The event was held at the Olympic Stadium on 9–10 August. It was won by the Bahamas.          The qualifying round experienced more drama than is normal in these affairs. In the first heat, on the second leg, Kenya's Vincent Mumo Kiilu was boxed in near the back of the pack, with South Africa's Ofentse Mogawane on his shoulder. Coming into the home straight, Kiilu tried to step to the outside, tripping Mogawane, leaving him injured on the track. The much awaited return of Oscar Pistorius waiting to run the third leg never materialized. South Africa filed a protest in which Kenya was disqualified and South Africa was allowed to run in the final. Conveniently, the London Olympic Stadium track has 9 lanes to accommodate such a circumstance, while normally only 8 lanes are used in Championship meets.          At the finish of the first heat, Trinidad and Tobago won the heat, setting their National Record, but host Great Britain was given exactly the same time.          In the second heat the United States led off with Manteo Mitchell. Half way around the track, Mitchell heard a crack and felt pain.          Mitchell continued to the hand off, running a sub-par 46.1 split. It was later revealed that Mitchell did break his left fibula. His American teammates continued on, running three sub 45 splits. Bahamas won the heat, but the Americans qualified, credited with exactly the same time as Bahamas, the fastest time in 2012. Both heats ending with the first and second place teams running the same times.          Also during the second heat, the Dominican Republic failed to make the second exchange between Felix Sánchez and Joel Mejía within the zone and were disqualified. Then halfway through the third leg, Jamaica's Jermaine Gonzales pulled a muscle and was unable to continue.          In the final, Bahamas started off with their best 400 runners, 4th place Chris Brown and 7th place Demetrius Pinder. Brown had a clear lead through the first 350 metres before fading to hand off just slightly ahead of Bryshon Nellum. Over the next leg, Josh Mance brought the American team into contention, with the two teams separating from the rest of the field. On the third leg, Tony McQuay passed Michael Mathieu early on the back stretch and extended the lead by a few metres. McQuay's split was reported to be 43.4. Last minute fill in Angelo Taylor took the baton in the lead, but Ramon Miller ran up to maintain contact. Coming off the final turn, he moved past Taylor with 50 meters to go and won. Trinidad and Tobago again improved their national record in winning the bronze. It was only the third time an American team had been beaten in the Olympic 4x400 metres relay.          Oscar Pistorius ran the anchor leg for the South African team, but they were already well beaten before he received the baton.          , the existing World and Olympic records were as follows.

A member of a prominent Philadelphia family, he played both tennis and cricket at high levels.          Alexander Van Rensselaer, known as Alec or Alex, was born in 1850 into a wealthy and influential Philadelphian family. His grandfather was Stephen Van Rensselaer. He graduated from Princeton University in 1871. On January 27, 1898, he married ""Sarah Drexel Fell"", daughter of Anthony Joseph Drexel.          Due to their ancestry, it was never necessary for the couple to work for a living. Instead they focused on fostering science and arts in Philadelphia. From 1901 until shortly before his death, Alexander was president of the Philadelphia Orchestra Association. In addition, he was a member of the board of trustees at Princeton University. Sarah gave large parts of her wealth to the Drexel Institute that was founded by her father. In 1901, Alex and Sarah traveled around the world and were guests of Japanese Emperor Meiji, the British royal family and the Viceroy of India.          An outstanding tennis player, Van Rensselaer took part in the first stagings of the US Tennis Championships in the 1880s, losing in the quarterfinals to Howard Taylor in 1884. In 1881, 1883 and 1884, he reached the finals of the doubles competition.          Van Rensselaer also played cricket at high levels, during a time when the sport in Philadelphia was at its most popular, and Philadelphian cricket teams regularly drew touring international teams to play in the United States, and went on overseas tours themselves. In the Halifax Cup, the premier American tournament at the time, Van Rensselaer represented the Young America Cricket Club, which won the tournament in 1880, 1881, 1883, and 1885. A wicket-keeper, he made a single appearance for the ""American Born"" in the 1880 American Born v English Residents match, scoring three runs for the match and recording two dismissals – a catch and a stumping. He was still playing as late as the 1891 season, aged 41, when he toured Chicago and Pittsburgh with the Germantown Cricket Club.

5606003,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5606003,Demonbane,"Kurou Daijuuji is a poor detective living in Arkham City. One day, he was requested by Ruri Hadou of Hadou Financial Group, to search for a magic book. While he initially refused, Ruri offered him a large sum of money upon completion of her request, in which bribed Kurou to accept. As Kurou searches for the book, he unexpectedly runs into Al, a pretty girl that is actually a powerful grimoire. They forge a contract with each other, bestowing Kurou with powerful magic. Soon afterwards, Al also activates Demonbane, a deus machina owned by the Hadou Financial Group, to combat the mechanical menace from the Black Lodge. With this, the war between the Hadou Financial Group and the Black Lodge begins.          ""Demonbane"" takes place primarily in a region resembling the Lovecraft Country common to several of the Mythos stories, including ""Herbert West-Reanimator"" and ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"". The majority of the plot is confined to Arkham City, the home and headquarters of the Hadou Financial Group as well as the location of the Miskatonic University. Arkham City is also the territory of a criminal organization known as the Black Lodge, which has access to an array of giant mecha as well as a number of powerful sorcerers that make it difficult for law enforcement to effectively combat. A separate portion of the story is set in the coastal town of Innsmouth and one of the climactic battles takes place over the sunken city of R'lyeh. The town of Dunwich is also referenced.          The player assumes the role of Kurou Daijūji, a private investigator that specializes in strange and unusual cases. Kurou used to attend the Miskatonic University, majoring in Archaeology while secretly studying sorcery, but dropped out after an unspecified incident that has caused him to become averse to dealing with occult matters. He has difficulty finding any work and, by the time the events of the story occur, can no longer afford to pay his utility bills. Kurou does have a good heart and tries to help others, usually explaining that he would be bothered by lingering regrets if anything bad happened that could have been prevented by his intervention.          Kurou often approaches Sister Leica, a nun who runs a church and orphanage in Arkham City, for food. She is very kindhearted and rarely refuses to help Kurou in his times of need but cares deeply about his well-being, constantly pressuring him to go back to his studies, graduate, and find a real job. She takes care of three orphans named George, Colin, and Alison. Ruri Hadou, another of ""Demonbane's"" heroines, is Kurou's employer and shoulders a heavy burden as the leader of the Hadou Financial Group following the death of her grandfather. Although outwardly resentful of Kurou for ""stealing"" her grandfather's legacy, she is also frustrated by her inability to influence the ongoing conflict personally and comes to depend on Kurou's strength.          ""Demonbane's"" final main character is Al-Azif, the physical embodiment of the legendary Necronomicon. Over the millennia, she has fought countless battles alongside countless masters. When one died she would simply discard them and find another, and inwardly feels deep regret for the way she treated them as mere tools even as they did the same to her. She is very short-tempered and arrogant but holds absolute confidence in her ability to confront and destroy evil.          In the space above Earth, the Deus Machina Aeon clashes with another unknown machine but due to its lack of a ""master"" it is defeated and crashes on the surface of the planet. Meanwhile, a starving Kurou Daijūji attempts to acquire food from a local church run by Sister Leica, a nun that he has known since he first moved to the city several years prior to the events of the story. The next day, Kurou is approached by Ruri Hadou, the current head of the Hadou Financial Group and her butler, Winfield. Ruri offers Kurou a job, citing his familiarity with the occult through his studies at the Miskatonic University: to procure a grimoire. Unable to refuse the generous pay she is offering, Kurou agrees and begins searching immediately.          The search for an authentic grimoire is fruitless, until Kurou happens upon a previously unknown bookstore with several powerful books. Unfortunately he is turned away by the store's owner, Nya, who cryptically states that a far more powerful grimoire is meant for him. This prediction is later proven true when a mysterious girl falls out of the sky onto him, subsequently introduced as Al-Azif, the physical manifestation of the Necronomicon, one of the most powerful grimoires in existence. Kurou is then attacked by her pursuers, the Black Lodge, under the command of the mad scientist Doctor West and forced by circumstances to enter into a contract with the grimoire. Doctor West retreats, only to return in one of his giant Destroyer Robots. Kurou escapes with the aid of Metatron, a masked hero that wages a one-man war against the Black Lodge, and stumbles upon an underground hangar containing an imitation Deus Machina, Demonbane. After commandeering the mech amidst the protests of its owner, Ruri, Kurou and Al-Azif (or Al, for short) are able to defeat the Destroyer Robot.          Although initially incensed at the prospect of someone outside the Hadou family piloting Demonbane, Ruri agrees to employ Kurou as the Deus Machina's pilot. Al wants to begin instructing him in the use of sorcery immediately, but before he has a chance to prepare, Kurou is attacked by the leader of the Black Lodge, Master Therion. Kurou is immediately overpowered but his use of Demonbane forces Therion to reveal his own grimoire: the Pnakotic Manuscripts, also known as Etheldreda. Therion spares Kurou's life, claiming that Kurou is the only individual who can alleviate his boredom, and vanishes. Kurou then begins training in sorcery while simultaneously searching for and recapturing pages that Al has lost. These pages eventually take on a life of their own and threaten the population, forcing him to subdue them physically before Al can reconstitute herself. Kurou's interference in the Black Lodge's operations causes Master Therion to send two of his elite Anticross sorcerers, Titus and Tiberius, to attack the Hadou headquarters directly. Doctor West also repeatedly attempts to make up for his failure to capture the Necronomicon, assisted by a self-aware gynoid of his own creation named Elsa. In one incident, West and Elsa are able to steal the pages relating to the Scimitar of Barzai and use them to create a copy of Demonbane that is subsequently defeated.          The story then moves to the coastal town of Innsmouth where Ruri has brought Kurou, Al, the Demonbane support team, and Leica on a beach holiday. Sensing the presence of evil on an island off the coast, Kurou and Al begin investigating, accompanied by the rest of the group. On the way they are attacked by Deep Ones and separated but each of the group is able to make their way to the island individually where they discover the inhabitants of Innsmouth, all Deep Ones themselves, performing a ritual to revive their god, Dagon. Overseeing them is another of the Anticross, Vespasianus, along with another powerful grimoire, the R'lyeh Text. The ritual fails but Dagon is revived in an incomplete, bestial state. The monster is only defeated when Demonbane channels the raw power of the Great Old One Cthugha, which nearly kills Kurou. Kurou is later able to acquire Al's pages concerning another Great Old One, Ithaqua, and obtains a pair of handguns that serve as conduits for their power from a mysterious individual known to the Black Lodge as the Tyrant.          In the meantime, it is revealed that both the Necronomicon and the Tyrant are essential to a major Black Lodge undertaking, the C Project, but Master Therion appears unconcerned by the fact that his underlings have had no success in capturing either of them. He placates the Anticross by explaining that he can use the Pnakotic Manuscripts in place of the Necronomicon and himself in place of the Tyrant but they remain unconvinced and plot rebellion behind his back. Finally, when the stars are right, the Black Lodge begins a ritual that raises their secret headquarters, the Illusionary Heart Mother, into the sky. They then reveal their full plan, using the R'lyeh Text to summon and bind another of the Great Old Ones: Cthulhu. Using an army of Destroyer Robots and the wave of insanity that accompanies the summoning, the Black Lodge lays waste to Arkham City. The Anticross betray Master Therion at the climax of the battle, seemingly destroying him along with Etheldreda, while Doctor West defects, disgusted by the perceived misuse of his technology. While Demonbane is able to drive off the Destroyer Robots, the Illusionary Heart Mother is able to teleport away, the Anticross having gained control over Cthulhu through a series of emergency measures.          The Hadou Group is able to locate the missing fortress at 47°9′S 126°43′W and mobilises a multinational taskforce through its connections to begin an attack. While they engage Cthulhu's forces in the sea, Demonbane is able to penetrate the fortress' defences and defeat the remaining Anticross. Master Therion then reveals himself, reborn as a result of his unique parentage; his father is the Outer God Yog-Sothoth and the true purpose of the C Project was to sacrifice Cthulhu as the catalyst of a ritual to summon it. Yog-Sothoth, the Gate and the Key, would then act as a portal through which the Outer Gods could then invade the physical universe. Therion challenges Kurou to follow him through the gate and, after saying his goodbyes, Kurou accepts. Demonbane then battles Therion's Deus Machina, Liber Legis, throughout time and space leading to a clash between the most powerful weapon in each mech's possession: the Shining Trapezohedron. Liber Legis is defeated but Al is finally able to access the totality of her sealed knowledge and discovers the identity of the one who orchestrated all of the story's events: Nya, also known as the Outer God Nyarlathotep. Kurou and Al battle the god and defeat it, preventing the destruction of reality. Nyarlathotep acknowledges its defeat but points out that it can always return with another scheme, leaving Demonbane becalmed in time and space.          A one episode OVA bundled with the PS2 Game Kishin Houkou Demonbane, it was released on July 1, 2004.          Lily Bridge, a young journalist, arrives at Arkham City, hoping to find a big scoop. However, with all the strange things occurring around the city, only the exceptional findings are news-worthy, such as the mysterious mecha known as Demonbane. However, upon finding a small piece of machinery that seemed to be connected with the Hadou Combine, Lily is determined to find the truth. Little does she know, she enters into a dark world, involving herself with Demonbane and the powerful forces that control the city.          Kishin Houkou Demonbane TV is an animated adaptation of Kishin Houkou Demonbane for the PS2, which began airing on May 18, 2006, and ended on August 17, 2006. The characters showcased in the TV series differ slightly from those in the PS2 Game. For example; Metatron has a few seconds of screentime in the first few episodes then never shows up again, Sandalphon is never seen, Ryuuga is seen only in the ending sequence, and Dagon's design was changed entirely.          Kuro Daijuuji is a poor detective living in Arkham City. One day, he is asked by Ruri Hado of Hado Financial Group, to search for a magic grimoire. As Kuro searches for the book, he unexpectedly runs into Al Azif, a pretty girl who turns out to be the grimoire Kuro is searching for. While being chased by the Black Lodge, Al forges a contract with Kuro, bestowing him with powerful magic. Soon afterwards, Al also activates Demonbane, a Deus Machina owned by the Hado Financial Group, to combat the mechanical menace from the Black Lodge. With this, the war between the Hado Financial Group and the Black Lodge begins...          The ending of the ""Demonbane"" anime series is original, made up for the TV series. It at first takes after Al's good ending, but instead of having her drift through space for aeons, it has the Elder Gods Kurou and Al-Azif (from Al's true ending) rescue her and bring her right back to Arkham, and Kurou's waiting arms.          Miskatonic University is a fictional university in the fictional town of Arkham, Massachusetts created by HP Lovecraft, an author of horror from the early 20th century. The Necronomicon is also a creation of HP Lovecraft who used the book of forbidden and maddening knowledge in several of his short stories. Other lovecraftian tomes that appear in the story include the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book of Eibon, De Vermis Mysteriis and many others.          Eps 1 ""I AM PROVIDENCE"" is named after a line in one of the letters HP Lovecraft had written during his life. In 1977 fans of Lovecraft had created a headstone to mark his burial place and on it they put the line from his letter ""I AM PROVIDENCE.""          Eps 3, ""Reaninator"" ""[sic]"" is likely a reference to Herbert West–Reanimator.          Eps 4, ""The Invaders"" is also the name of a Cthulhu Mythos story by Henry Kuttner.          Eps 5, ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" is also a story of the same name by HP Lovecraft. The fishlike Deep Ones in the episode also feature in the short story.          eps 9, ""The Hunt"" is also the name of a Cthulhu Mythos story by Henry Kuttner.          Eps 11 ""The Return of the Sorcerer"" would but a nod to Clark Ashton Smith's ""The Return of the Sorcerer."" Clark Ashton Smith was a correspondent of HP Lovecraft while he lived. In the story itself, the Necronomicon is quoted.          Eps 12, ""Strange Eons"" is a name taken from the book written by Robert Bloch of the same name. Bloch was a good friend of HP Lovecraft. Bloch is best known for the novel turned movie he wrote called ""Psycho."" It references a line from the Necronomicon mentioned in several of Lovecraft's stories, ""That is not dead which can eternal lie / And with strange aeons even death may die.""          Al Azif's name is derived from the Arabic name for the Necronomicon, ""Kitab al-Azif.""          Azrad's name was taken from the name of the author of the Necronomicon, Abdul Alhazred.          The Shining Trapezohedron is also the name of an ancient artifact in the HP Lovecraft story ""The Haunter of the Dark"".          The guns of the Demonbane, Cthuga and Ithaqua, are names of creatures that appear in other Lovecraftian horror stories.          Often, Al is seen either sitting or sleeping on a squishy, large, orange object, with a single eye, which occasionally speaks ""Tekeli-li"". It is a Shoggoth named ""Dunsany"".

It is operated by the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT), the umbrella organization that plans, integrates, and coordinates public transport services across this region.          The Candiac Line was originally operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) between 1887 and 1980. The AMT resumed passenger service on this line in 2001.          There are 9 inbound and 9 outbound trains each weekday.          This line links the Lucien-L'Allier station in downtown Montreal with Candiac, on Montreal's South Shore.          The line offers nine departures every weekday towards Montreal and nine return trips to Candiac every weekday. Most departures are during rush hour, but three are offered during off-peak hours in each direction.          Service started on September 4, 2001 with 2 round trips every day. One trainset was used for both departures. In September 2003, service was increased to 4 round trips per day and a second trainset was used. Service was extended to Candiac in 2005. In 2009, two additional departures were added in each direction with leased trainsets being used until new locomotives and rolling stock is received.          Service on the line was suspended from February 17, 2006 to March 9, 2006 after the derailment of 6 Canadian Pacific freight cars on February 17. The freight cars derailed on the Saint-Laurent Railway Bridge used by the train service. This was one of the longest disruptions in train service for the AMT. High winds were a factor in that derailment. In September 2013 CP banned AMT's multilevel coaches from the bridge during high wind conditions (85 km/h or more), deeming them potentially unstable in such conditions. Since then AMT has used only its single-level 700 series coaches on this line.          The line was renamed on July 1, 2010 from ""Delson-Candiac"" to simply ""Candiac"" to standardize formatting across the network.          To improve service and attract new users on the Candiac line, the AMT will carry out three major projects:          The following stations are on the Candiac line:          The commuter line operates over the following Canadian Pacific Railway subdivisions:          South Jct is not a passenger stop.","['AMT commuter rail lines', 'Transport in Mont\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9gie', 'Railway lines opened in 2001', 'Railway lines opened in 1887']"

28510091,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28510091,Sealed unit,"In 1924 Ernest Fisk (later Sir Ernest) of AWA - Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) suggested the introduction the ""sealed unit"" system (or, more commonly ""sealed set"" or ""sealed receiver"") where radio sets could only receive the transmitting service (or services) to which they were licensed. Under this model, the Government would issue a licence to transmit on a given wavelength (or frequency in modern terminology) and oversee the manufacture of receivers locked on that wavelength. The owner of the transmitting licence could then charge the receiver's owner a recurrent fee that would be used to run the station. This was seen as preferable to the British situation where the Government backed a monopolistic service (the British Broadcasting Company as it was then) and collected a single licence fee from each household with a receiver. There appears to have been little attention at the time to a third possible model; that of the licensee charging for advertisements, as was done in the United States.          Radio Amateurs were compelled to sign agreements that they would not carry out activities that would challenge this project. Under the legislation being drafted to implement this policy, it would be illegal for the consumer to do unauthorised tampering with the radio.          The following stations operated under the system:          As quickly as July 1924, the Sealed Set system was declared to be unsuccessful and it was replaced by a system of A Class and B Class stations. There were one or two A Class stations in each major market and these were paid for by a listener's licence fee imposed on all listeners-in. The five former Sealed Set stations became A Class stations, and they were soon joined by stations in other State capitals, and by a number of B Class (later commercial stations).          A lot of today's electronic game products have chipsets with keys, that make it difficult or impossible to interchange the integrated circuits in the device, in order to repair it, or to carry out certain interface or applications. Some people do get around the keys, but it is quite an involved process. There is quite a good counterculture scene however, and there are quite a few people who do this.          For minidisc recorders that have a USB port, it is very difficult to get your original recording out to a computer, because the set is firewalled, to prevent copying. An HD minidisc recorder will refuse to allow the digital transfer of an ordinary NET MD recording, and will only allow you          one go at copying an original HD-minidisc recording that you have made.          The transfer can only be done with the program ""Sonic Stage"" generally supplied with the recorder.          Even when you do copy the original ATRAC file to the computer, it will only play on that particular computer and will also no longer play if you change the computer's operating system.          Without effective circumvention, it is necessary to get sonic stage to produce a wave file, and to never overwrite yor original minidisc, in order to adequately preserve whilst distributing your recording.

60364,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60364,Mostly Harmless,"Mostly Harmless is a novel by Douglas Adams and the fifth book in the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series. It is described on the cover of the first editions as ""The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhikers Trilogy"". It was the last Hitchhiker's book written by Adams.          The title derives from a joke early in the series, when Arthur Dent discovers that the entry for Earth in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" consists, in its entirety, of the word ""Harmless"". His friend Ford Prefect, a contributor to the ""Guide"", assures him that the next edition will contain the article on Earth that Ford has spent the last 15 years researching—somewhat cut due to space restrictions, but still an improvement. The revised article, he eventually admits, will simply read """"Mostly"" harmless"". It later turns out that Ford had written a long essay on how to have fun on Earth, but the editors in the guide's main office building edited everything out. Later in the series, Ford is surprised to discover that all of his contribution had been edited back into the Guide, prompting his reunion with Arthur on the alternative Earth in ""So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"".          Arthur Dent plans to sightsee across the Galaxy with his girlfriend Fenchurch, but she disappears during a hyperspace jump, a result of being from an unstable sector of the Galaxy. Depressed, Arthur continues to travel the galaxy using his biological donations to DNA banks to fund his travels, and knowing that he cannot die until he visits Stavromula Beta, as told to him by the insane Agrajag who had been repeatedly killed in various ways by Arthur before being reincarnated. During one trip, he ends up stranded on the homely planet Lamuella, and decides to stay to become a sandwich maker for the local population.          Meanwhile, Ford Prefect has returned to the offices of the Hitchhiker's Guide, and is annoyed to find out the original publishing company, Megadodo Publications, has been taken over by InfiniDim Enterprises, which are run by the Vogons. Fearing for his life, he escapes the building, along the way stealing the yet-unpublished, seemingly sentient Hitchhiker's Guide Mk. II. He goes into hiding after sending the Guide to himself, care of Arthur, for safekeeping.          On Lamuella, Arthur is surprised by the appearance of Trillian with a teenage daughter, Random Dent. Trillian explains that she wanted a child, and could use the only human DNA she could find, thus claiming that Arthur is Random's father. She leaves Random with Arthur to allow her to better pursue her career as an intergalactic reporter. Random is frustrated with Arthur and life on Lamuella; when Ford's package to Arthur arrives, she takes it and discovers the Guide. The Guide helps her to escape the planet on Ford's ship after Ford arrives on the planet looking for Arthur. Discovering Random, the Guide, and Ford's ship missing, the two manage to find a way to leave Lamuella and head for Earth, where they suspect Random is also heading to find Trillian. Ford expresses concern on the Guide's manipulation of events.          Reporter Tricia McMillan is an alternate version of Trillian living on Earth who never took Zaphod Beeblebrox's offer to travel in space. She is approached by an extraterrestrial species, the Grebulons, who have created a base of operations on the planet Rupert, a recently discovered tenth planet in the Solar System. However, due to damage to their ship in arriving, they have lost most of their computer core and their memories, with the only salvageable instructions being to observe something interesting with Earth. They ask Tricia's help to adapt astrology charts for Rupert in exchange for allowing her to interview them. Tricia conducts the interview, but the resulting footage looks fake. She is called away from editing the footage to report on a spaceship landing in the middle of London.          As Tricia arrives, Random is leaving the ship. Random yells at Tricia, believing Tricia to be her mother. Arthur, Ford, and Trillian arrive and help Tricia to calm Random. They remove her from the chaos surrounding the spacecraft and take her to a bar. Trillian tries to warn the group that the Grebulons, having become bored of their mission, are about to destroy the Earth. Random disrupts the discussion by producing a laser gun she took from her ship. Arthur, still believing he cannot die, tries to calm Random's nerves, but a distraction causes her to flinch. She fires the weapon, sending the bar into a panic. Arthur tends to a man hit by the blast, and learns he is another reincarnation of Agrajag. He also discovers that the bar is named ""Stavro Mueller – Beta"". Arthur makes out Ford laughing wildly at this turn of events. Arthur, despite the panic beginning around him, experiences a ""tremendous feeling of peace"".          The Grebulons, having determined that removing Earth from the astrological charts will improve their horoscopes, destroy it. It is revealed that the Vogons designed the Guide Mk. II with the ability to see the potential outcome of any event, enabling it to ensure that every version of the Earth in all realities is destroyed. With its mission complete, the Guide collapses into nothingness.          Dirk Maggs adapted the book as the ""Quintessential Phase"" of the radio series, and it was broadcast in June 2005. The radio version has an entirely new, upbeat ending, appended to the existing story.          In the alternate ending, after the destruction of Earth, the description of the Babel fish from the earlier series is replayed with an additional section, which states that dolphins and Babel fish are acquainted, and that the dolphins' ability to travel through possibility space (first mentioned in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and elaborated on in ""So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"") is shared by the Babel fish as well. During the ending, Ford explains that the dolphins got taught this skill from the Babel fish in exchange for knowing a good place to have parties. All the major characters are carrying Babel fish in their ears, which rescue them at the moment of Earth's destruction by transporting them to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The characters are reunited with Marvin, and it is revealed that beyond the Restaurant (and beyond the car park in which Marvin works) lies an endless series of blue lagoons — the final destination of the dolphins. The series ends with Arthur asking Fenchurch, ""Will you come flying with me?"", and her reply, ""Always.""          The version released on CD contains an even longer set of alternate endings, including one set after the events of the twelfth radio episode (with Arthur Dent and Lintilla), and on an alternate Earth where Arthur Dent and Fenchurch engage in a stand-off against Mr Prosser, together.          There have been four unabridged audiobook recordings of the novel. In 1992, Adams himself recorded an edition, later re-released by New Millennium Audio in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. In 2006, actor Martin Freeman, who had played Arthur Dent in the 2005 movie, recorded a new edition of the audiobook. This is the only book in the five novel series not to have also had a prior, abridged edition read by Stephen Moore.          In addition, the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped released a version of the book, narrated by George Guidall-Shapiro, on 4-track cassette tape in 1993. They released the book again as part of a larger work called ""The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" (with forward by Neil Gaiman, and including other books in the series), narrated by David Cutler; available on cassette as RC 62183, and in encrypted DAISY downloadable form as DB 62183.

It is one of the two books that was used to create the movie ""The Towering Inferno"", the other being ""The Tower"".          The story concerns the events over the course of a single evening in a recently completed high-rise building (66-stories-tall) in an unnamed American city. The building was called the National Curtainwall Building, nicknamed the Glass House, the headquarters of the fictitious National Curtainwall corporation. A combination of a skyscraper built to the absolute minimum compliance with safety rules, combined with cutting corners to save money on construction, leads to a disaster waiting to happen.          Craig Barton, the building’s architect, is to meet for dinner with the building’s owner, Wyndom Leroux, in the building’s Promenade room. During drinks and dinner Barton questions Leroux regarding the specifications of the building and whether or not they have been altered from his original plans, why they have been altered and what the consequences of this may be. After dinner they are alerted by the hostess that there is a fire in one of the building’s storage rooms on the 17th floor. Barton is sent down by Leroux to assist with the firefighting operations while his wife, Jenny, remains at dinner with Leroux and his wife Thelma.          A small home furnishings store owner, despondent over his near bankruptcy, decides to burn his business down for the insurance. He tries to do so, but realizes what it will do to his business partner and lover, Larry. He puts out the fire but realizes that he's now really ruined because of what he has done. He then discovers that he is smelling smoke which is not from the fire he tried to set, but is from a real fire, unrelated to his, that has occurred in the building.          A part of the story deals with a TV reporter named Quantrell, who, using a disgruntled former employee of the contractor, was given copies of documents relating to the building's construction. In one scene, Quantrell uses them on his television show to point out how the building was designed in violation of local building codes at the time the drawings were made, and that the local building codes were changed afterward to allow the design to be in compliance, implying that the owners of the building paid bribes to have the building codes rewritten. The reporter gets threats from all sides to back down on his aggressive reporting of the building's failures.          After the initial alarm of fire division chief Mario Infantino, a chief who specializes in high-rise fires, is called to the scene and given the overall command by fire chief Karl Fuchs, whose son, Mark, is also a fireman at the scene. Barton and Infantino, who have been friends before the fire, work to understand what is happening to the building as flames race through its poorly constructed heart.          The story continues as it shows the efforts of other residents of the building attempting to escape the flames, some successful, some not. One character is the brave Lisolette (also featured in the Irwin Allen film adaptation). Eventually a number of people end up in the penthouse restaurant of the building, where they are trapped and unable to get down. They are eventually rescued successfully by helicopter.          The fire is eventually put out by blowing up water tanks below the roof of the building, which causes the water to drown the fire.","['1974 novels', '20th-century American novels', 'American novels adapted into films', 'American thriller novels', 'Doubleday (publisher) books', 'Novels by Frank M.

The role was created by Agnes Nixon and originated by Robin Strasser on March 8, 1967, who played the role through December 10, 1971. Strasser would briefly return to the role from February 17, 1972 until June 29, 1972. During Strasser's absence, Margie Impert portrayed the role from December 27, 1971 to February 15, 1972. Victoria Wyndham took over the role on July 21, 1972, staying on until the show's final episode on June 25, 1999.          Rachel Davis was born to Gerald (Walter Mathews) and Ada Davis (Constance Ford). Her father walked out when she was young and she was raised solely by her mother. Growing up poor, Rachel dreamed of a glamorous life and was determined to do whatever it took to get it.          Rachel met Russ Matthews (Sam Groom) when she was recovering from a fainting spell while modelling, and married him because she believed he was part of a wealthy Bay City family. It turned out Russ had wealthy family members, but he was middle class. Rachel fell head over heels for wealthy Steve Frame (George Reinholt), but he was in love with Russ's sister, Alice (Jacqueline Courtney). Rachel encouraged Alice not to let her handsome and rich suitor get away, but was secretly planning to have for herself. She would find any excuse to double-date with Alice and Steve.          As much as she tried, Steve only had eyes for Alice. Rachel couldn't understand what Steve saw in Alice. She was too sweet and too nice. Rachel believed he needed a real woman and she was determined to be THAT woman for him. Besides, Rachel had something in common with Steve that Alice did not: they both came from similarly poor backgrounds and, as adults, had broken free.          One night after a heated argument with Russ about what a real man Steve was compared to him, Rachel left the Matthews home and moved in with her mother. One night, she visited Steve in his apartment, who was depressed after a fight he had with Alice. Taking full advantage of Steve's vulnerability, Rachel seduced him into bed and later told her mother in her classic smug way that not only did she get Steve in bed, but that she was going to divorce Russ and marry Steve.           Rachel later found out she was pregnant and knew the baby had to be Steve's. She crashed his and Alice's engagement party and informed the happy couple she was having Steve's baby. Steve flat out refused to believe that the baby was his and wanted to have nothing to do with her. Frantic, Rachel charmed Russ into a reconciliation and tried to pass off her baby as his. She gave birth to a son named James Gerald Matthews, nicknamed Jamie. When the truth about Jamie came out, Rachel's marriage to Russ was over. Steve still married Alice and Rachel jumped into a short-lived marriage with Ted Clark (Stephen Bolster), with whom she ran a restaurant. Rachel managed to tear Steve and Alice apart by telling him he could only see Jamie in her presence, making her believe they were having an affair. Rachel was thrilled when Steve and Alice divorced. Steve married Rachel for Jamie's sake. The marriage was quickly over and Steve went back to Alice yet again. Steve and Alice remarried and Steve was sent to jail for embezzlement. Rachel tried to throw Alice out of the house Steve had built for her. Alice was already on the verge of a mental breakdown and this helped push her over the edge.          Ultimately, it was death and not Rachel's interference that caused the end for Steve and Alice, when Steve was presumed dead in a helicopter crash in Australia.          Rachel met the love of her life, Mac Cory (Douglass Watson), at his ""Welcome to Bay City"" party. They dated for a few months and married on Valentine's Day. The beginning of their marriage was full of love and happiness—his wedding present to her was the mansion she lived in the rest of the series. Mac's daughter, Iris Carrington (Beverlee McKinsey), was a constant thorn in their sides. Iris did everything she could to break Mac and Rachel up, but her schemes always failed. Iris even played a part in Rachel's miscarriage, because she knew Rachel was in trouble and did nothing to help. The miscarriage created a rift between Mac and Rachel. Wanting her to have something of her own, Mac arranged for Rachel to have sculpture lessons. Rachel fell in love with sculpting and devoted so much time to it that it caused problems with Mac. Their marriage nearly fell apart when Mac had a one-night-stand while Rachel was at her first big showing in New York, but their love was too strong and they worked thorough it. Their marriage was put to the test again after their maid Helga arranged for Rachel to see Mac in bed with another woman. They had a daughter named Amanda and Mac was overjoyed that he finally had a biological daughter since Iris was adopted. Upon learning this, Iris went out of her way to ruin their marriage. She convinced Rachel to buy off Jamie's fiancé, which created another rift between her and Mac.           Their marriage finally disintegrated when Mac had an affair with Janice Frame (Christine Jones). They divorced and fought over custody of Amanda. Janice and Mac married. Janice was having an affair with Mitch Blake (William Gray Espy) and the pair planned to murder Mac and take his money. Mitch backed out and told Rachel about Janice's plan. Rachel went to St. Croix to save Mac, but she had to sleep with Mitch in order for him to tell her where they were. Rachel found Mac just as he was poisoned by Janice, but before they could escape, Janice came at them with a knife. The two women fell into a pool, Rachel stabbed Janice, and she died.          Rachel was mortified to discover she was pregnant with Mitch's baby, but still remarried Mac. She confronted Mitch, accidentally shot him, and the building he was in was burned to the ground. When a body was found, Rachel went on trial for his murder. She was forced to admit during the trial that the child she was carrying was Mitch's, leaving Mac heartbroken. She was found guilty and sentenced to eight years in prison. Mac started divorce proceedings. Rachel first arranged for her newborn son Matthew, named in honor of the Matthews family, to be raised by her ex-husband Russ and his new wife, singer Tracy Merrill (who was subsequently killed in a mob hit). However, Mac protested, desiring to raise Matthew himself. Mac felt something was not right about Mitch's death. He and Jamie (now played by Richard Bekins), and Rachel, who had been let out of prison for a day to attend the funeral of her stepfather, Charley Hobson (Fred J. Scollay), managed to track down a very much alive Mitch. It turned out he did not remember the events surrounding his supposed death.           Rachel was now free and Mac dropped the divorce. Mac was still jealous of Mitch, who had returned to Bay City to be closer to his son. It turned out Mac's jealousy was warranted since Rachel began an affair with Mitch. Despite protests from Jamie and Ada, Rachel decided to start a new life with Mitch and divorced Mac. Ultimately, things did not work out for Mitch and Rachel and she left him. Mitch kidnapped Matthew, but he was caught and sent to prison.          Mac became engaged to Rachel's longtime nemesis, Alice Frame and it appeared that it was finally over for Mac and Rachel. A mysterious stranger named Edward Black came to town. He turned out to none other than Steve Frame (now played by David Canary) back from the dead. He had amnesia after the accident as well as extensive plastic surgery. Both Rachel and Alice found themselves drawn to him again. Steve and Alice got back together, but she dumped him when she found out he wanted Rachel. Steve and Rachel became engaged, but Steve was killed in a car accident on their way to the airport to elope. Rachel was temporarily blinded from the accident, and through her recovery, she and Mac found themselves falling for each other again. They remarried for what would be the last time.          Shortly after this, Carl Hutchins (Charles Keating) showed up in Bay City. Rachel took a liking to him, but Mac hated him on sight. Rachel was kidnapped by Carl, who wanted to get back at Mac for allegedly causing his father's death, but was rescued in time. She temporarily suffered amnesia, but her love for Mac brought her back.           Mitch was released from prison and came back to Bay City. He determined to have a relationship with Matthew, but Rachel did not want him anywhere near her son. There seemed to be a possibility that Rachel and Mitch might rekindle their affair, but Rachel put a stop to it. Matthew and Mitch grew close, with his parents' blessing.           Iris (now played by Carmen Duncan) returned to Bay City. Mac was happy to see his daughter again, while Rachel still had her reservations about Iris. When a mysterious publishing house called Bennett Publishing brought Cory Publishing to the brink of destruction, Rachel teamed up with Donna Hudson (Anna Stuart) to investigate. The only thing that was known about Bennett Publishing was that it was run by someone called ""The Chief."" Rachel found out ""The Chief"" was none other than Iris herself! Rachel confronted Iris and demanded she tell Mac. Mac was devastated by this revelation and went on a trip to Maine to reflect. Sadly, Mac died suddenly of a heart attack. Rachel was devastated by Mac's death. He was her anchor, her lover, and her best friend. Although she eventually fell in love again and even remarried years later, a part of her heart would always belong to Mac. Rachel tearfully buried the love of her life.          In his will, Mac left equal shares of Cory Publishing to Rachel, Iris, and Amanda. When the vote came down, Iris was voted in as CEO thanks to a tiebreaker vote by Jamie's estranged wife, Vicky (Anne Heche). Jamie (Laurence Lau) had won sole custody of their son, Steven, and Vicky offered to vote for Rachel if she was given Steven back, but Rachel refused.           Rachel began a short relationship with Ken Jordan (Lewis Arlt), which ended when she discovered he had only wanted revenge against Mac. Mac's illegitimate daughter, Paulina Cantrell (Cali Timmins), had arrived in town with Ken. Rachel embraced her as part of the family and the two became good friends.          When her beloved mother died of heart failure, Rachel lost the only person who had always been there for her. Her family rallied around her to help her through the difficult loss.          Rachel's sworn enemy, Carl Hutchins, returned to town. Carl wanted Rachel to pretend to date him so he could fix his reputation and form a relationship with his newly discovered son, Ryan Harrison (Paul Michael Valley). Against all odds, Rachel and Carl fell in love with each other. They married much to the disapproval of pretty much everybody in Bay City, particularly Iris. Iris planned to scare Carl by shooting blanks at him during the wedding ceremony, but Evan Frame (Eric Scott Woods), Janice's son, replaced the blanks with real bullets and Carl was shot. He survived and Iris was sent to jail.           They had many problems with their marriage, especially after Carl refused to let go of his vendetta against Grant Harrison (Mark Pinter) after he killed Ryan (Grant's half-brother), but their love proved stronger than any adversity. In 1997, they had twin children, Elizabeth and Cory. Rachel discovered at the same time that she had a tumor, but she chose to continue her pregnancy and risk her life for her babies. Their marriage was stronger than ever until Carl's oldest enemy, Alexander Nikos, showed up in town. After a few months of feuding, Nikos kidnapped Rachel, only returning her because of his love for Felicia Gallant (Linda Dano). Rachel and Carl's marriage took another downfall when it was revealed that Amanda was posing as Hadley Prescott, Carl's ""lover."" Rachel knew about this secret, but refused to tell Carl. Carl left town for a while after he found out that Rachel knew about ""Hadley."" Rachel and Carl have since reconciled after they found out that Shane Roberts (Robert Kelker-Kelly), the man who had received Ryan's corneas, was killed.          Rachel had to deal with Carl's change of character. She wanted to trust her husband, but it looked like he was reverting to his old ways. However, Rachel had to mourn one more dead husband when Carl was shot by Scott Guthrie and ""burned alive"" in the hospital's ICU unit. From then on, Rachel concentrated on restoring Cory Publishing to its former glory. Carl turned out to be alive and suffering from a brain tumor. He had an operation to have it removed and they reunited.           Rachel spent years as a manipulative troublemaker. She mellowed out and became a successful wife, mother, artist, and businesswoman. The woman who, at one point, most of Bay City could not stand, became the heart and soul of it.","['Another World (TV series) characters', 'Fictional characters introduced in 1967', 'Fictional sculptors']"
754791,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=754791,Bro Gozh ma Zadoù,"Bro Gozh ma Zadoù () is the anthem of Brittany, sometimes presented as the ""national anthem"" although it has no official status. It is sung to the same tune as that of the national anthem of Wales, ""Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"", and has similar words. The Cornish anthem, ""Bro Goth Agan Tasow"", is also sung to the same tune.          The Breton lyrics are the creation of François Jaffrennou in 1897, and the music was that composed by James James, of Pontypridd, Wales, for ""Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"". The new song was first published in 1898, and circulated as ""Henvelidigez"" (""Adaptation""). It was chosen as national anthem (and a song to celebrate friendship between the Welsh and Bretons) in 1903, at a Congress of the Union Régionaliste Bretonne held in Lesneven. Maurice Duhamel adapted it for the piano, and it was first recorded by Pathé in 1910.          Ni, Breizhiz a galon, karomp hon gwir vro!           Brudet eo an Arvor dre ar bed tro-dro.

The Company is also responsible for Instow signal box which opens on occasional Sundays and bank holidays from Easter to October.          A railway museum exists in the rebuilt Bideford signal box and also in the green PMV (Parcels and Miscellaneous Van). Short passenger rides were given at Bideford until vandalism temporarily prevented services operating. The site was mothballed shortly afterwards when housing development threatened to encroach on to the trackbed. This threat has now been removed and the company is working on renovating the site and rolling stock, so that services can recommence. The site is accessible from the Tarka Trail and the museum is open when staffing allows.          Former British Railways rolling stock owned by the railway includes a PMV van and a BR standard brake van. A Hibberd Planet diesel locomotive is also present. British Railways Mark 1 coach S4489, owned by Devon County Council but managed by BRHC, is at the station acting as the Tea on the Train cafe for users of the Tarka Trail.          The line was opened from Barnstaple to Fremington in 1848. Passenger trains ran throughout from Barnstaple railway station to Bideford from 2 November 1855 as the Bideford Extension Railway. The line was further extended to Torrington in 1872 when the current Bideford railway station was opened.          Passenger services ceased on 2 October 1965 although ball clay traffic continued until 1982. The track was removed in 1985 after some interest by BR in reintroducing a passenger service to Bideford. The trackbed was later converted into the Tarka Trail, a walkway using the formation between Petrockstow (later the terminus of services after the line was truncated in the 1960s) and Barnstaple Junction.          In 2009, James May attempted to reconnect the former Bideford station with Barnstaple Junction using an OO scale model train as part of ""James May's Toy Stories"". Unfortunately, the last train - a Hornby Class 395 ""Javelin"", and the prototype model for the production models - burnt out at Instow at 12:18am the day after the trains left Barnstaple at around 3:00pm.          In 2011, May returned to complete the challenge with the help of the German model railway attraction Miniature Wonderland, racing several model trains over the 9.89 miles from Barnstaple to Bideford. The first train to arrive at Bideford was a Hornby Intercity 125, followed by a hydrogen-powered train and finally, May's own model of LNER 'Pacific' 4472 ""Flying Scotsman"".","['Railway museums in England', 'Heritage railways in Devon', 'Museums in Devon', 'Bideford']"

Posthumously honored with the title of King Zhongxiao, Wu was the son of Wu Hua and became a timber merchant. He was also known as the Duke of Ying and King of Wei serving as army commander of Yingyang Prefecture during the final years of Emperor Yang of Sui (r. 605-618 CE) and subsequently as Minister of Revenue and superintendent of Jingzhou City, Hubei during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 627-649 CE).           Initially, Wu married a woman from the Xiangli family, who gave birth to two sons named Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang. Later he remarried a woman from the noble Yang family of the Hong Nong region. She was daughter, niece, and sister to several ministers and a close relation of the imperial family. By her, Wu had three daughters: Wu Shun (later the Lady of Han), Wu Zhao (Empress Wu Zetian) and the Lady of Guo.          After Wu died in 635 CE his two sons were rude to their stepmother so Wu Zetian banished her half-brothers from the imperial court. At the same time she named her sister Madam Han's son Helan Minzhi as heir to her father. However, Wu Zetian became displeased with Helan Minzhi's conduct and sent him into exile where he died. Thereafter she recalled Wu Yuanshuang's son Wu Chengsi from exile and made him Wu Shihou's successor.

39141887,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39141887,Lusinga Iwa Ng'ombe,"Lusinga Iwa Ng'ombe (c. 1840–1884) was a slave trader in the region to the west of Lake Tanganyika in the 1870s and early 1880s.          Lusinga was born around 1840 in ""Buluba"", the lands to the northeast of Lubanda that were inhabited by the eastern Luba people.          He came from the Sanga (""Bushpig"") clan.          At some time Lusinga seems to have visited Unyanyembe, near Tabora in modern Tanzania, where he realized the value that was attached to slaves and ivory.           He obtained muskets, or armed retainers, and was the first to use firearms in the region west of the lake.          With this superior weaponry he quickly defeated the chiefs in the region of Cape Tembwe, a key point for the trade crossing Lake Tanganyika, and settled there in a fortified village. After reducing the local population by his slaving activity, and under pressure from other slavers, he moved to a new base two days walk from Lubanda in the Mugandja mountains, on the Muswe tributary of the Lufuko River.          By the end of his career, Lusinga had sixty wives.           These provided a useful labor force for agricultural work, giving Lusinga increased wealth.          The British explorer Joseph Thomson met Lusinga in 1879. He described him as a ""sanguinary potentate"" due to the ruthlessness with which he captured slaves for the East African trade.          The Belgian soldier Émile Storms was given the task of establishing a Belgian base on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika.          He reached Mompara on the west shore of the lake in April 1883.          He met the chief Mpala, who gave permission to build the post in his territory.          On 4 May 1883 the foundations of the station of Mpala were laid. Chief Mpala and Storms became blood-brothers in a ceremony on 25 June 1883.           Lusinga was present at this ceremony.          To consolidate his power in the region, during 1884 and 1885 Storms made a series of attacks on Lusinga and his supporters. He pillaged their villages and took the loot back to his fort at Mpala, where some of it was lost when the fort burned down.          In November 1884, while in Karema, Storms heard that Lusinga was preparing to make war on Mpala.          Storms dispatched a force of his men and men from Paul Reichard's expedition to defeat Lusinga.          They managed to bluff their way into Lusinga's fortress, where they shot him and took his head.          Storms replaced Lusinga as chief by Ukala the Nyamwezi, one of Storms' allies.          Storms collected a standing figure of Lusinga during a raid on his village in 1884.          The figure, in the Luba style, is designed to display his new royal status.          It is held in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium.          Storms also brought Lusinga's skull to Europe when he returned, and gave it to the anthropologist Émile Houzé,           who wrote a treatise on the subject in which he saw ""degeneracy"" in the skull.

""Pleqërishte"" means both ""of old men"" and ""of the old time"" in reference to the mode of singing and the lyrical themes of part of their songs respectively. In relation to these subjects ""pleqërishte"" songs are also called ""lashtërishte"" (""of the ancient time""), a term used exclusively in Gjirokastër. These specific topics have largely fallen into public disuse over the years but remain thematically notable.          Songs of the genre adhere to a slow tempo and low pitch with little vocal variation as opposed to genres such as ""djemurishte"" (""of young men"") in particular.           As all fourth-part genres they feature a third soloist (""hedhës""). While in other four-part genres the ""hedhës"" mainly assumes the role of secondary drone a minor third above the keynote, in ""pleqërishte"" the ""hedhës"" relieves the first soloist (""marrës"") and allows him to take a breathing break. Each rendition begins with the singing of the first lines by the ""marrës"" and the introduction of the second soloist (""kthyes"") and finally the ""hedhës"". After the ""hedhës"", the ""marrës""'s lyrics are repeated by the drone group in various forms and manners.          ""Pleqërishte"" songs are exemplified in the repertory of the folk group ""Pleqtë e Gjirokastrës"" sometimes regarded as the ""last representative"" of the genre. One of the best-known songs of the genre and most notable renditions of the group is ""Doli shkurti, hyri marsi"", which details a battle between Çerçiz Topulli and Ottoman troops in 1908 in the village of Mashkullorë near Gjirokastër.",['Albanian music']
20308980,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20308980,Stock-Raising Homestead Act,"The Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 provided settlers of public land—a full section or its equivalent—for ranching purposes. Unlike the Homestead Act of 1862 or the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909, land homesteaded under the 1916 act separated surface rights from subsurface rights, resulting in what later became known as split estates. The subsurface rights, also known as mineral rights, are the foundation of recent oil and gas law in the United States.          Under the act no cultivation of lands was required, but some range improvements were mandated as necessary.          By 2006, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and subsequent legislation and other legal changes resulted in the federal government administering the subsurface rights to about of land, of which have surface rights owned privately or by a U.S. state.

25819815,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25819815,Chasqui I,"Chasqui I is a late-2000s one-kilogram nanosatellite project that was launched by hand during a spacewalk on August 18, 2014 from the International Space Station. The concept satellite was intended to be equipped with two cameras, a visible and an infrared, which could take photos of the Earth.          The Chasqui I was being developed by students at UNI and was part of an educational project that seeks to acquire the experience and ability in developing satellites. UNI in collaboration with the European Space Agency was working on Chasqui II satellite and other project is the UNI-KURSK microsatellite developed in collaboration with the University of Kursk (Russia).          Capacities of UNI in satellite technology through the design, analysis, assembly, integration, test, launch and operation of a technology nanosatellite Cubesat. The satellite Chasqui I plans included taking pictures of the earth with transmission to a ground station.          Specific objectives include:          Goals include:          The nanosatellite Chasqui I research project is an effort to secure Peru's access to space, along with the previous launched satellites, and gives the opportunity to open new application areas specific to its own geographical and social reality. It is also from an academic point of view a tool that facilitates collaboration between the various faculties of the university trains students and teachers with real world experience in satellite, allowing technological advances in the aerospace industry in the country. The development of small-scale satellites like Chasqui I gives way to the various opportunities of access to space with lower costs and development time. For this reason, various universities, companies and government organizations in the world show interest in developing nanosatellites that allow to carry out experiments and scientific missions. The educational benefits of the project can be emphasized in training camp for future engineers and scientists.          The research project Chasqui I nanosatellite built a miniaturized satellite based on the CubeSat technology, the mass of the satellite is less than 1 kg and it has a volume of up to 1 Lt. The project demonstrates its utility in imaging land, more specifically from the Peruvian region, using a CMOS camera that seeks to distinguish between fertile land and uncultivated areas. To minimize the cost of development and construction, Chasqui I was constructed using commercial components. However, the very fact of using these components in a space environment presents new challenges in relation to tolerance to temperature and radiation and also presents increased requirements in areas related to redundancy when designing hardware and software components. Additionally, Chasqui I will use the amateur radio frequency, making it possible to be accessed by an entire amateur radio community can be located throughout the country, increasing the educational potential of the project. The project also includes the implementation of a ground station that allows monitoring of Chasqui I, as well as monitoring other small satellites of universities.          Peru has a large geographical diversity, which makes it very difficult to constantly monitor the situation of certain events, whether natural or man-made, such as permanent snow melting, deforestation of the Amazon, the protection of habitats of endangered species, combating narco-terrorism, surveillance of borders and territorial sea, the prediction and mitigation of natural disasters, etc. It is in this context that space technology is presented as an alternative to solve problems of national interest. UNI, with its project Chasqui I, are taking steps in the process of addressing problems such as crop monitoring and telecommunications areas.          The project Chasqui I, which initially was formative in nature, has evolved into a technological and scientific challenge for all members of the project. It is expected that Chasqui I allows to plant the foundations for future work in the area of small satellites and, to be increasing their size or number, give rise to satellite projects in different categories, in areas such as: communications, meteorology, remote sensing, earth images, navigation and oceanography.          The research group module mechanical structure (EMEC) is responsible for reviewing the state of art, comparative analysis of existing cases to the pico-satellite design and manufacture our own model based on the Standard Cubesat.          Within the pico-satellite will be assembled the following modules: Central Control and Management Information (CCMI), Unit Identification and Attitude Control (DCA), Imaging Management System (SIMA), Unit Power and Thermal Control (PCT) and Communications System (SICOM).          This module manages and monitors information from all subsystems Chasqui I. The module to meet the goals set must have within it a processor (called OBC: On Board Computer), which fulfills the following functions in each module:          The data managed are: Data from the camera, Data Maintenance and commands.          The first subsystem is the Power and is responsible for receiving, processing, storing and distributing power to other subsystems in the Chasqui I. The objective of this subsystem is to ensure electricity supply for Chasqui I give it the energy needed at the right time.          The second subsystem is the Thermal Control and he is responsible for maintaining the temperature of the batteries and other components of the satellite in its operating range, in order to ensure the functioning of Chasqui I. The most critical task of this subsystem is to maintain the batteries to operate within its limit of operation (0 °C to 20 °C.). Through heaters specifically designed and constructed at the National University of Engineering.          Both subsystems are being designed and built at the National Engineering University.          The TT & C module is responsible to provide a means of communication between the peak itself and the satellite earth station.          The main objective of the research group is to obtain photographs of the Earth from Chasqui I. SIMA The module consists of two cameras, a visible range and the other in the near infrared range. Digital information is collected by the Central Control Module and Management Information (CCMI) and then sent to the Earth Station (ESTER).          Additionally, the Group is responsible for processing digital images obtained by the Chasqui I.          The SDCA maintains the pico-satellite stabilization and guidance to a desired direction when necessary. Specifically, we can say that SDCA is responsible for:          The SDCA enables the pico-satellite by using sensors to determine its attitude, calculate the correction required to achieve the desired orientation and execute the necessary maneuvers using the actuators. The attitude determination system will use magnetometers, sun sensors and attitude determination algorithms for estimating positions and angular velocities. Using GPS and gyroscopes as sensors for determining attitude will also be evaluated. The attitude control system will use electromagnetic coils and permanent magnets as actuators, forming what are known as magnetorquers. The electromagnetic coils are especially important for the stabilization of the pico-satellite once it leaves the deployer. The inclusion of the permanent magnet can have a system of active-passive control. More than one control law will be studied for possible implementation. The use of magnetic materials and hysteretic also be evaluated.          This subsystem is not part of the satellite itself, but its existence and operation is necessary to achieve the objectives of Chasqui I. The set of facilities and wireless communication (radio) needed to communicate with the Chasqui I, and any satellite.          The main functions of this module are:          The module aims to simulate the trajectories of Chasqui I, which is previously calculated differential equations of motion and then solve them in parallel with two programs: Delphi and Matlab.          This simulation is accomplished by taking into consideration the following phases:          The module aims to achieve the assembly of components developed by different modules of the project as electronic circuit boards, cameras, batteries, antennas, sensors, and electromagnetic coils.

Of the five colleges, the largest is Chancellor College in Zomba. The name of the school is abbreviated to UNIMA. It is part of the Malawian government educational system. The present Vice Chancellor is Professor John Kalenga Saka. UNIMA celebrated its golden jubilee from the 24 to the 26 September 2015.          The vision of the University of Malawi is to provide ""relevant, world-class education, research and services for the sustainable development of Malawi and the world.""          The university is the center of knowledge, development of skills values, ideas and attitudes for engaging developmental challenges in the country.          The University of Malawi was founded a few months after Malawi Independence. The first enrollment consisted of 90 students in Blantyre. Teaching began in 1965 in Blantyre, and within two years the Institute of Public Administration at Mpemba, the Soche Hill College of Education and the Polytechnic in Blantyre, and Bunda College in Lilongwe became colleges of the university. In 1973, all the constituents of the university apart from the polytechnic and Bunda College moved to Zomba and were merged into Chancellor College. In 1979, Kamuzu College of Nursing became a college of the university, and in 1991 the College of Medicine in Blantyre was formed as a further constituent college.          During the movement towards multiparty rule, UNIMA students participated through a student protest. In March 1992, when Catholic Bishops in Malawi issued a Lenten Pastoral Letter that criticized Banda and his government, students of the University of Malawi at Chancellor College and the Polytechnic joined in through protests and demonstrations in support of the letter. This forced the authorities to close the campuses.          Youth for Freedom and Democracy (YFD) is a student political pressure group on campus. They publish the ""Weekly Political Update"" that is circulated to students on campus. They have been critical of Malawi's governance, and of the Paladin Energy mining company. In mid September, Malawian police arrested several members of the group. They also arrested 21-year-old Black Moses, president of the YFD and interrogated him. A week later, 25-year-old Robert Chasowa, a fourth-year engineering student at the Malawi Polytechnic was found dead. Police ruled this a suicide but critics believe that he was murdered.          Bunda College of Agriculture offers BSc's, MSc's and PhD degrees in Agriculture, Environmental Sciences and Development Studies. Its mission is to advance and promote knowledge,skills,self-reliance and sound character for "" sustainable food production and utilization; Improving income, food security and nutrition; and Conservation and management of biodiversity, the environment and natural resources.          It is situated in Lilongwe 35.2 km from the capital city center. Nearby is the College farm serving commercial, practical, academic and research purposes.          Note: Bunda college is no longer part of unima following the restructuring of universities in Malawi in 2012 by the late president Bingu Muthalika. Now Bunda forms part of Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR).          Chancellor College is the largest college of the constituent colleges of the University of Malawi. It is also known as 'Chanco'. The college has five faculties: Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Social Science and Faculty of Education. Departments service each faculty as follows:           Education: Curriculum and Teaching Studies and Educational Foundations          Humanities: African Languages and Linguistics, Classics, English, Fine and Performing Arts, French, Language and Communication Skills, Philosophy and Theology and Religious Studies.          Science: Biology, Chemistry, Geography and Earth Sciences, Home Economics, Physics, Mathematical Sciences.          Social Science: Economics, History, Psychology, Political and Administrative studies and Sociology.          The University of Malawi houses a medical school, the College of Medicine (COM), which trains Malawian doctors that work both in Malawi and internationally. candidates to be considered for medical training either enter after a one-year premedical training following their MSCE or after completing two years of a science course at Chancellor College. Out of about 250 doctors that had graduated from the University of Malawi-College of Medicine between 1992 and 2005, 25 (10%) were reported to be registered with the UK General Medical Council which has contributed to a healthcare worker brain drain in Malawi.          The College of Medicine has seen tremendous advancement in its board of administrators and infrastructure ever since its introduction in 1992. The college now has Four undergraduate courses which include the five-year-long Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS), and the four-year-long programs of Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Sciences (BMLS), Bachelor of Physiotherapy (Hon) and Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hon). All the undergraduate students need to undergo a one-year premedical program at the college or must have finished their A-levels at recommended schools or must have attended a two-year science course at recommended college in order to be eligible for the programs offered at the College of Medicine. In addition, the college has a long stating relationship with the University of St Andrews School of Medicine in Scotland. In 2011, 10 students from the University of St Andrews School of Medicine visited the college on exchange. Both schools run the Global Health Education Workshops/Module (GHEP) which seeks to provide a forum for discussion of pressing global health issues like climate change, overpopulation, epidemics and the concept of good aid.          Entry requirements for nursing and paramedical training institutions is the          Malawi School Certificate of Education (Ordinary Level). Nursing and midwifery training is for three years and is offered at the Malawi College of Health Sciences and any of the eight mission nursing schools scattered in mostly rural mission hospitals. The Kamuzu College of Nursing provides nursing degrees categorised as generic (degrees offered to students enrolled from straight from secondary school), post-basic (degrees offered to enrolled nurses who have‘acceptable’ O-level grades and with at least two years of service) Bachelor of Science in Advanced Midwifery and Diploma in Nursing. Out of an estimated 4000 nurses active in Malawi in 2005, 453 who had been trained in Malawi were reported to be working in OECD countries (WHO, 2006). This represented 11.3% of the number of nurse active in the country.          Polytechnic has fifteen departments offering undergraduate degrees in accounting, business administration, management, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, architecture and land management, environmental management, computing and information technology, journalism, language and communication, mathematics and statistics, physics and biochemical sciences, technical education and quantity surveying.          Polytechnic offers postgraduate programs in business administration, infrastructure development and transport management in response to the emerging needs of the industry and the pressure from the native baccalaureate graduates.          The University of Malawi had 6,257 full-time students in 2007. Of those, 6226 were Malawian citizens, 26 were from SADC countries and 5 were from other, non-SADC countries.","['University of Malawi', '1964 establishments in Malawi', 'Educational institutions established in 1964', 'Schools of medicine in Malawi', 'Academic freedom', 'University of Malawi alumni', 'University of Malawi faculty']"

Lying along the Yaquina River east of Newport, it is on Elk City Road off U.S. Route 20 at Toledo. Elk City lies at the confluence of Big Elk Creek with the river, about upstream from the Yaquina river mouth. Ocean tides affect the water levels this far upriver.          Named for the creek, Elk City was ""said to have been the first settlement in what is now 'Lincoln County'."" A post office was established at this location, then called ""Newton"", in 1868. In 1888, the name was changed from Newton to Elk City. The Elk City post office closed in 1958.          The Corvallis and Yaquina Wagon Road Company established Elk City in 1866 by building a warehouse with a store and by laying out a town. A year later, Elk City had a second store, a hotel, and a structure doubling as a church and schoolhouse. Boats regularly ascended the river to Elk City, the last stop on the overland mail route of the time, and delivered mail downriver by water.          In the late 19th century, Elk City was one of the stops on the Oregon Pacific Railroad, linking the former port city of Yaquina to Corvallis and Albany. After the Oregon Pacific failed financially, fell into receivership, and went through 17 years of financial and legal complications, it became a branch line of the Southern Pacific in 1907.          Efforts to restore a covered bridge over the Yaquina River at Elk City fell short in 1981. Fund-raising for repairs had produced $20,000, and restoration had begun when high winds caused another $90,000 damage to the structure. The county did not have enough money to pay for restoration or to pursue an insurance settlement through the courts. The original bridge, built by the county in 1922, was a Howe truss span supported by wooden pilings that suffered from rot.          Elk City Park, operated by Lincoln County, is in Elk City. The area has 12 campsites, parking, day-use areas, and a boat launch. Elk City Park is open all year, but the campground and restrooms are closed from November to March.","['Unincorporated communities in Lincoln County, Oregon', 'Unincorporated communities in Oregon']"

34172023,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34172023,Echoes (Anggun album),"Echoes (English version) / Échos (French version) is the fifth international studio album by Indonesian recording artist Anggun. The English version was first released by Sony Music in Anggun's native country on 20 May 2011 and the French version was released by Warner Music in Belgium on 4 November 2011. The album was re-packaged in 2012 to promote her participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. The album was produced by Anggun—the first time since her international career—under her own record label April Earth. She co-wrote all original materials on ""Echoes"", alongside Gioacchino Maurici, Pierre Jaconelli, Jean-Pierre Pilot and William Rousseau. However, ""Échos"" also became her first French album on which she does not have any writing credit.          Upon its release, ""Echoes"" topped the Indonesian Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the first week. It eventually received quadruple platinum and became the best-selling pop album of 2011 in Indonesia. Meanwhile, ""Échos"" reached number 48 on the French Albums Chart and has sold over 15,000 copies in France. ""Echoes"" received Gold Export Award for its sales outside France. Singles released were ""Only Love""/""Hanyalah Cinta"", ""Buy Me Happiness"", ""Berkilaulah"" and ""Echo (You and I)"" from ""Echoes"", as well as ""Je partirai"", ""Mon meilleur amour"", ""Echo (You and I)"" and ""Quelques mots d'amour"" from ""Échos"".          The album was made by Anggun in two production teams: Gioacchino Maurici and Pierre Jaconelli on the one hand, and the duo of Jean-Pierre Pilot and William Rousseau on the other. Anggun produced and co-wrote all original material for ""Echoes"". Meanwhile, ""Échos"" is Anggun's first album sung entirely in French (as previous albums had songs or interludes in English or Indonesian) as well as her first French album where she does not have any writing credit.          Of their collaboration, Maurici said: ""I love [Anggun's] timbre. I'd been wanting to work with her for a while. I found in her the very same depth of personality that I liked about her voice."" Jean-Pierre Pilot and William Rousseau were coming off the back of major successes in France when they met Anggun. ""What surprised us was the contrast between the simple, fun-loving woman we had in front of us and the image of the superstar diva we know from her videos or live performances. The two personalities coexist inside her in perfect harmony,"" William Rousseau explains. ""As a result, we were keen to explore her more private side without going off into completely pared-down musical style.""          The album's first single, ""Only Love"""", is an Irish-influenced track which deals with the quest for true and unconditional love. ""A Stranger"" timidly speaks of the loneliness and fear of the unknown that were often a feature of the singer’s constant moving around. Whereas a few years ago Anggun still sang of exile as a painful experience, now she knows where she is headed, as she has accepted that her destiny will always be bound up with travelling. ""Year of the Snake"" is a restrained song that gives the thoughts of a woman remembering painful momentsof her life. And yet, without any excess exoticism or pointless clichés, you find subtle traces of the singer’s Indonesian roots via the various subjects she tackles. ""Eternal"" talks of accepting the death of a loved one, without seeking to squeeze a tear out of the listener at any cost. On the other hand, the extremely sensual ""Rollercoaster"", composed by Axel Bauer, conjures up the passion and sense of drama that can be part of the singer's life as well. Many women will identify with the themes of the album: an upbeat girl’s power message in ""Weapons"", the weariness of ""My Addiction"" or the acceptance of who we really are in ""Impossible"". Anggun reveals herself to be both mischievous and totally fulfilled. Yet the power of the melodies does not supplant the emotion, as illustrated by the bittersweet ""Buy me happiness"" and the discreet ""Silent vow"".          ""Only Love"", along with its Indonesian version ""Hanyalah Cinta"", was released as the lead single from ""Echoes"" in Indonesia in April 2011. The single became a number-one airplay hit in the country. Two more singles were sent to Indonesian radio: ""Buy Me Hapiness"" in July and ""Berkilaulah"" in October 2011. ""Je Partirai"" served as the lead single from ""Échos"" for French-speaking territories in May 2011. It peaked at number five on Belgian Ultratip Chart, while reaching number three on French International Airplay Chart compiled by Francophonie Diffusion. The music videos for ""Only Love"", ""Hanyalah Cinta"" and ""Je partirai"" were shot in one session by French director Jean-Baptiste Erreca in Bangkok, Thailand.          A new version of ""Mon meilleur amour"" was released as the second single off the French version on 28 October 2011. Its music video was directed in Romania by French director Roy Raz. French entry for Eurovision Song Contest 2012, ""Echo (You and I)"", was released on 30 January 2012 as the third single from ""Échos"" and the lead single from the international edition of ""Echoes"". Roy Raz again directed its music video. The fourth and final single from ""Échos"", ""Quelques mots d'amour"", was released onto iTunes on 16 March 2012. A digital extended play titled ""Quelques mots d'amour"" was released a year later, featuring the single alongside three ballads off ""Échos"" and one ballad off her previous album ""Elevation"".","['2011 albums', 'Anggun albums', 'English-language albums', 'French-language albums']"
36563,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36563,Magnetic field,"A magnetic field is the magnetic effect of electric currents and magnetic materials. The magnetic field at any given point is specified by both a ""direction"" and a ""magnitude"" (or strength); as such it is a vector field. The term is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols and , where is measured in units of amperes per meter (symbol: A·m or A/m) in the SI. is measured in teslas (symbol:T; note that although the symbol is capital T, ""tesla"" is written in lower case in the SI system) and newtons per meter per ampere (symbol: N·m·A or N/(m·A)) in the SI. is most commonly defined in terms of the Lorentz force it exerts on moving electric charges.          Magnetic fields can be produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property, their spin. In special relativity, electric and magnetic fields are two interrelated aspects of a single object, called the electromagnetic tensor; the split of this tensor into electric and magnetic fields depends on the relative velocity of the observer and charge. In quantum physics, the electromagnetic field is quantized and electromagnetic interactions result from the exchange of photons.          In everyday life, magnetic fields are most often encountered as a force created by permanent magnets, which pull on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt, or nickel, and attract or repel other magnets. Magnetic fields are widely used throughout modern technology, particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics. The Earth produces its own magnetic field, which is important in navigation, and it shields the Earth's atmosphere from solar wind. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in the discipline of magnetic circuits.          Although magnets and magnetism were known much earlier, the study of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles. Noting that the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points 'poles' in analogy to Earth's poles. He also clearly articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.          Almost three centuries later, William Gilbert of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus' work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet. Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, ""De Magnete"", helped to establish magnetism as a science.          In 1750, John Michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an inverse square law. Charles-Augustin de Coulomb experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that the north and south poles cannot be separated. Building on this force between poles, Siméon Denis Poisson (1781–1840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824. In this model, a magnetic -field is produced by 'magnetic poles' and magnetism is due to small pairs of north/south magnetic poles.          Three discoveries challenged this foundation of magnetism, though. First, in 1819, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that an electric current generates a magnetic field encircling it. Then in 1820, André-Marie Ampère showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract one another. Finally, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart discovered the Biot–Savart law in 1820, which correctly predicts the magnetic field around any current-carrying wire.          Extending these experiments, Ampère published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model. This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, Ampère derived both Ampère's force law describing the force between two currents and Ampère's law, which, like the Biot–Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Ampère introduced the term electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.          In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He described this phenomenon in what is known as Faraday's law of induction. Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Ampère's force law. In the process he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.          In 1850, Lord Kelvin, then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted and . The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Ampère's model and induction. Further, he derived how and relate to each other.          The reason and are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the Metre, abbreviated ""m"". Others believe the choices were purely random.          Between 1861 and 1865, James Clerk Maxwell developed and published Maxwell's equations, which explained and united all of classical electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled """" in 1861. These equations were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper ""A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field"" and demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave. Heinrich Hertz experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.          The twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See moving magnet and conductor problem for details about the thought experiment that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop special relativity.) Finally, the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to form quantum electrodynamics (QED).          The magnetic field can be defined in several equivalent ways based on the effects it has on its environment.          Often the magnetic field is defined by the force it exerts on a moving charged particle. It is known from experiments in electrostatics that a particle of charge in an electric field experiences a force . However, in other situations, such as when a charged particle moves in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire, the force also depends on the velocity of that particle. Fortunately, the velocity dependent portion can be separated out such that the force on the particle satisfies the ""Lorentz force law"",          Here is the particle's velocity and × denotes the cross product. The vector is termed the magnetic field, and it is ""defined"" as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. This definition allows the determination of in the following way          Alternatively, the magnetic field can be defined in terms of the torque it produces on a magnetic dipole (see magnetic torque on permanent magnets below).          In addition to , there is a quantity , which is also sometimes called the ""magnetic field"". In a vacuum, and are proportional to each other, with the multiplicative constant depending on the physical units. Inside a material they are different (see H and B inside and outside of magnetic materials). The term ""magnetic field"" is historically reserved for while using other terms for . Informally, though, and formally for some recent textbooks mostly in physics, the term 'magnetic field' is used to describe as well as or in place of .          There are many alternative names for both (see sidebar).          In SI units, is measured in teslas (symbol: T) and correspondingly (magnetic flux) is measured in webers (symbol: Wb) so that a flux density of 1 Wb/m is 1 tesla. The SI unit of tesla is equivalent to (newton·second)/(coulomb·metre). In Gaussian-cgs units, is measured in gauss (symbol: G). (The conversion is 1 T = 10,000 G.) One nanotesla is also called a gamma (symbol: γ). The -field is measured in amperes per metre (A/m) in SI units, and in oersteds (Oe) in cgs units.          The precision attained for a magnetic field measurement for Gravity Probe B experiment is 5 attoteslas (); the largest magnetic field produced in a laboratory is 2.8 kT (VNIIEF in Sarov, Russia, 1998). The magnetic field of some astronomical objects such as magnetars are much higher; magnetars range from 0.1 to 100 GT (10 to 10 T). See orders of magnitude (magnetic field).          Devices used to measure the local magnetic field are called magnetometers. Important classes of magnetometers include using a rotating coil, Hall effect magnetometers, NMR magnetometers, SQUID magnetometers, and fluxgate magnetometers. The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation that is detectable in radio waves.          Mapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First, measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a vector) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.          An alternative method to map the magnetic field is to 'connect' the arrows to form magnetic ""field lines"". The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength.          Magnetic field lines are like streamlines in fluid flow, in that they represent something continuous, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines. An advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the 'number' of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the surface integral of the magnetic field.          Various phenomena have the effect of ""displaying"" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field, form lines that correspond to 'field lines'. Magnetic field ""lines"" are also visually displayed in polar auroras, in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.          Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension, (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. 'Unlike' poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; 'like' poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The rigorous form of this concept is the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor.          ""Permanent magnets"" are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.          The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's ""strength"" (called its magnetic dipole moment ). The equations are non-trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its by 180 degrees.          The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modelling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having their own . The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles. And, any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.          There are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, and . Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.          It is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges. This is called the Gilbert model of magnetism, after William Gilbert. In this model, a magnetic -field is produced by ""magnetic charges"" that are 'smeared' around each pole.           These ""magnetic charges"" are in fact related to the magnetization field           The -field, therefore, is analogous to the electric field , which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all -field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out) all -field lines point toward the south pole. A north pole, then, feels a force in the direction of the -field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the -field.          In the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength separated by a small distance vector , such that . The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field both inside and outside           magnetic materials, in particular the fact that is opposite to the           magnetization field inside a permanent magnet.          Since it is based on the fictitious idea of a ""magnetic charge density"", the Gilbert model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.          After Ørsted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is where is the area of the loop.          These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic -field. One important property of the -field produced this way is that magnetic -field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, is a solenoidal vector field); a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve. To date no exception to this rule has been found. (See magnetic monopole below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet -field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north. If a -field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S pairs.          More formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the 'number' of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:          where the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for -field pointing out and negative for -field pointing in.          There is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in Maxwell's equations below.          The force between two small magnets is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field of the other.          To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the ""magnetic pole model"" given above. In this model, the ""-field"" of one magnet pushes and pulls on ""both"" poles of a second magnet. If this -field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is ""nonuniform"" (such as the near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.          This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.          The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field.          Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment due to a magnetic field is:          where the gradient is the change of the quantity per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of . To understand this equation, note that the dot product , where and represent the magnitude of the and vectors and is the angle between them. If is in the same direction as then the dot product is positive and the gradient points 'uphill' pulling the magnet into regions of higher -field (more strictly larger ). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own then summing up the forces on each of these very small regions.          If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a ""magnetic torque"" on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.          Magnetic torque is used to drive electric motors. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of electromagnets. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See Rotating magnetic fields below.          As is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to , where is a constant called the vacuum permeability, measuring V·s/(A·m) and is the angle between and .          The Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is the field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz force described below. Again, the results are the same although the models are completely different.          Mathematically, the torque on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment of the magnet:          where × represents the vector cross product. Note that this equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if is in the same direction as the magnetic field. (The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.) Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.          Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.          All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving point charges, such as electrons, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.          Magnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the ""right hand grip rule"" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)          Bending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or ""solenoid"" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron core may act as an ""electromagnet"", generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.          The magnetic field generated by a steady current (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point) is described by the ""Biot–Savart law"":          where the integral sums over the wire length where vector is the vector line element with direction in the same sense as the current , is the magnetic constant, is the distance between the location of and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and is a unit vector in the direction of .          A slightly more general way of relating the current formula_6 to the -field is through Ampère's law:          where the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and formula_6 is the current enclosed by that loop. Ampère's law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the -field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid.          In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Ampère's law is one of four Maxwell's equations that describe electricity and magnetism.          A charged particle moving in a -field experiences a ""sideways"" force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the ""Lorentz force"", and is given by          where          The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no work on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary magnetic dipole, or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.          The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a charge carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the ""Laplace force"".          Consider a conductor of length , cross section , and charge due to electric current . If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude that makes an angle with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge is          so, for charges where           the force exerted on the conductor is          where .          The direction of force on a charge or a current can be determined by a mnemonic known as the ""right-hand rule"" (see the figure). Using the right hand and pointing the thumb in the direction of the moving positive charge or positive current and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field ""can"" distinguish between these, see Hall effect below.          An alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule Flemings's left hand rule.          The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own bound current, which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the spin of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The -field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of ""magnetization"" first.          The ""magnetization"" vector field represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A·m, the SI unit of magnetization is ampere per meter, identical to that of the -field.          The magnetization field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside of the magnet.)          In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called ""bound current"". This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic field due to the magnet. (See Magnetic dipoles below and for more information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:          where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and is the 'bound current' enclosed by that closed loop.          In the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive 'magnetic pole strength' (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:          where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface and is the 'magnetic charge' (in units of magnetic flux) enclosed by . (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.          In SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by          In terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is          where represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of does not depend at all on the bound currents.           For the differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law leads to the boundary condition           where is the surface free current density and the unit normal formula_18 points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.          Similarly, a surface integral of over any closed surface is independent of the free currents and picks out the 'magnetic charges' within that closed surface:          which does not depend on the free currents.          The -field, therefore, can be separated into two independent parts:          where is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents.          The magnetic -field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of 'magnetic charges'. The field lines loop only around 'free current' and, unlike the magnetic field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.          Most materials respond to an applied -field by producing their own magnetization and therefore their own -field. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term ""magnetism"" describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior:          In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:          where is a material dependent parameter called the permeability. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that may not point in the same direction as . These relations between and are examples of constitutive equations. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex to relation; see magnetic hysteresis.          Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that this energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.          For linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that where is frequency-independent), the energy density is:          If there are no magnetic materials around then can be replaced by . The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.          In general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume needed to cause a small change of magnetic field is:          Once the relationship between and is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For hysteretic materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.          A changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an electric field (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as ""Faraday's law"" and forms the basis of many electrical generators and electric motors.          Mathematically, Faraday's law is:          where formula_25 is the electromotive force (or ""EMF"", the voltage generated around a closed loop) and is the ""magnetic flux""—the product of the area times the magnetic field normal to that area. (This definition of magnetic flux is why is often referred to as ""magnetic flux density"".)          The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that ""opposes"" the ""change"" in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as Lenz's law.          This integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.          Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as ""Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law"" and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)          The full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell–Ampère equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.           The Maxwell term ""is"" critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form electromagnetic waves, such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.          Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its ""sources"". (For the ""sources"" are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up ""Maxwell's Equations"". Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism.          The first property is the divergence of a vector field , , which represents how 'flows' outward from a given point. As discussed above, a -field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of is zero. (Such vector fields are called solenoidal vector fields.) This property is called Gauss's law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the charge density (See Gauss's law).          The second mathematical property is called the curl, such that represents how curls or 'circulates' around a given point. The result of the curl is called a 'circulation source'. The equations for the curl of and of are called the Ampère–Maxwell equation and Faraday's law respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.          The complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:          where = complete microscopic current density and is the charge density.          Technically, is a pseudovector (also called an ""axial vector"") due to being defined by a vector cross product. (See diagram.)          As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric field and an applied magnetic field by producing their own internal 'bound' charge and current distributions that contribute to and but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, and fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the ""free current density"" and ""free charge density"" :          These equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the 'bound' charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between and as well as that between and . On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.          According to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.          Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 tensor, called the ""electromagnetic tensor"". Changing reference frames ""mixes"" these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity ""mixes"" space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum and energy into four-momentum.          In advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the ""vector potential"" , and the scalar potential , are defined such that:          The vector potential may be interpreted as a ""generalized potential momentum per unit charge"" just as is interpreted as a ""generalized potential energy per unit charge"".          Maxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity with little effort. In relativity together with forms the four-potential, analogous to the four-momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler—and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.          In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a ""classical"" field, but rather a quantum field; it is represented not as a vector of three numbers at each point, but as a vector of three quantum operators at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is ""quantum electrodynamics"" (QED), which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the ""Standard Model of particle physics"".          In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their antiparticles) is computed using perturbation theory. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged.          Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10 (and limited by experimental errors); for details see precision tests of QED. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.          All equations in this article are in the classical approximation, which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.          The Earth's magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents in the outer liquid of Earth's core. The Dynamo theory proposes that these movements produce electric currents that, in turn, produce the magnetic field.          The presence of this field causes a compass, placed anywhere within it, to rotate so that the ""north pole"" of the magnet in the compass points roughly north, toward Earth's North Magnetic Pole. This is the traditional definition of the ""north pole"" of a magnet, although other equivalent definitions are also possible.          One confusion that arises from this definition is that, if Earth itself is considered as a magnet, the ""south"" pole of that magnet would be the one nearer the north magnetic pole, and vice versa. The north magnetic pole is so-named not because of the polarity of the field there but because of its geographical location. The north and south poles of a permanent magnet are so-called because they are ""north-seeking"" and ""south-seeking"", respectively.          The figure is a sketch of Earth's magnetic field represented by field lines. For most locations, the magnetic field has a significant up/down component in addition to the north/south component. (There is also an east/west component, as Earth's magnetic and geographical poles do not coincide.) The magnetic field can be visualised as a bar magnet buried deep in Earth's interior.          Earth's magnetic field is not constant—the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal. The most recent reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.          The ""rotating magnetic field"" is a key principle in the operation of alternating-current motors. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by Nikola Tesla, and later utilized in his, and others', early AC (alternating current) electric motors.          A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.          This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, three-phase systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's electrical power supply systems.          Synchronous motors use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled—and induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.          In 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the ""Royal Academy of Sciences"" in Turin.          The charge carriers of a current carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the ""Hall effect"".          The ""Hall effect"" is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).          An important use of is in ""magnetic circuits"" where inside a linear material. Here, is the magnetic permeability of the material. This result is similar in form to Ohm's law , where is the current density, is the conductance and is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law () is:          where formula_30 is the magnetic flux in the circuit, formula_31 is the magnetomotive force applied to the circuit, and is the reluctance of the circuit. Here the reluctance is a quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux.          Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of circuit theory.          The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current and an area . Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:          where the direction of is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area has been reduced to zero and its current increased to infinity such that the product is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einstein–de Haas effect ""rotation by magnetization"" and its inverse, the Barnett effect or ""magnetization by rotation"". Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.          It is sometimes useful to model the magnetic dipole similar to the electric dipole with two equal but opposite magnetic charges (one south the other north) separated by distance . This model produces an -field not a -field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism.          A ""magnetic monopole"" is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a ""magnetic charge"" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.          Modern interest in this concept stems from particle theories, notably Grand Unified Theories and superstring theories, that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.          In recent research, materials known as spin ices can simulate monopoles, but do not contain actual monopoles.","['Magnetism', 'Physical quantities']"

564098,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564098,USS Pittsburgh (CA-72),"USS ""Pittsburgh"" (CA–72), originally named USS ""Albany"" (CA-72), was a ""Baltimore""-class heavy cruiser of the US Navy. The third ship to bear this name, it was laid down on 3 February 1943 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard at Quincy, Massachusetts; launched on 22 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs Cornelius D. Scully, wife of the Mayor of Pittsburgh; and commissioned at Boston on 10 October 1944, with Capt. John Edward Gingrich in command.          ""Pittsburgh"" trained along the east coast and in the Caribbean until departing Boston on 13 January 1945 for duty in the Pacific. After calling in Panama and final gunnery exercises in the Hawaiians, she joined TF 58 at Ulithi on 13 February, assigned to TG 58.2 formed around the aircraft carrier .          The force sortied on 10 February to prepare the way for the assault on Iwo Jima. Carrier air strikes against airfields near Tokyo on 16 and 17 February limited Japanese air response to the initial landings on 19 February. That day planes from ""Pittsburgh's"" group began direct support to Marines fighting to overcome fierce Japanese resistance on the island. Final strikes against Tokyo's environs on 25 February and 1 March against the Nansei Shoto completed this operation.          The force sailed from Ulithi on 14 March to pound airfields and other military installations on Kyūshū on 18 March, and again the next day. The Japanese struck back at dawn on the 19th, with an air raid which set the carrier ablaze, her decks utter chaos and power lost. ""Pittsburgh"" dashed to the rescue at . After saving 34 men from the water, ""Pittsburgh"", with the light cruiser , performed an outstanding feat of seamanship in getting a tow line on board the flaming carrier. ""Pittsburgh"" then began the agonizingly slow task of pulling the carrier to safety, as the flattop's crew struggled to restore power. Twice gunning off enemy air attacks attempting to finish ""Franklin"", the cruiser continued her effort until noon, on 20 March when ""Franklin"" was able to cast off the tow and proceed, albeit slowly, under her own power. Capt. Gingrich had remained at the conn for 48 hours during the situation.          Between 23 March and 27 April, ""Pittsburgh"" guarded the carriers as they first prepared for, then covered and supported, the invasion of Okinawa. Enemy airfields were interdicted, and the troops given direct aid from the carriers. ""Pittsburgh"" repelled enemy air attacks and launched her scout planes to rescue downed carrier pilots. After replenishing at Ulithi, the force sortied once more on 8 May to attack the Nansei Shoto and Southern Japan in the continuing fight for Okinawa.          On 4 June, ""Pittsburgh"" began to fight a typhoon which by early next day had increased to winds and waves. Shortly after her starboard scout plane had been lifted off its catapult and dashed onto the deck by the wind, ""Pittsburgh's"" second deck buckled, her bow structure thrust upward, and then the front fell off. However, not a man was lost. Still fighting the storm, and maneuvering to avoid being rammed by the drifting bow-structure, ""Pittsburgh"" was held quarter-on to the seas by engine manipulations while the forward bulkhead was shored. After a seven-hour battle, the storm subsided, and ""Pittsburgh"" proceeded at to Guam arriving on 10 June. Her bow, nicknamed ""McKeesport"" (a suburb of Pittsburgh), was later salvaged by the tug and brought into Guam.          With a false bow, ""Pittsburgh"" left Guam on 24 June bound for Puget Sound Navy Yard, arriving 16 July. Still under repair at war's end, she was placed in commission in reserve on 12 March 1946 and decommissioned on 7 March 1947.          The typhoon damage also earned her the nickname ""Longest Ship in the World"" as literally thousands of miles separated the bow and stern.          As the Korean War called for a major restoration of US naval strength, ""Pittsburgh"" recommissioned on 25 September 1951, Capt. Preston V. Mercer in command. She sailed on 20 October for the Panama Canal, trained out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and prepared at Norfolk for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet for which she sailed on 11 February 1952. Returning on 20 May, she joined in the Atlantic Fleet's schedule of exercises and special operations in the western Atlantic and Caribbean.          During her second Mediterranean cruise, for which she sailed on 1 December, she flew the flag of Vice Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander in Chief, Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean for a good-will cruise to the Indian Ocean in January 1953. She returned to Norfolk in May for a major modernization overhaul, but rejoined the 6th Fleet at Gibraltar on 19 January 1954. Once again she carried Admiral Wright to ports of the Indian Ocean during this cruise which ended with her return to Norfolk on 26 May. During the summer of 1954, she engaged in further operations along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. On 29 July 1954, the ""Pittsburgh"" collided with another ship while sailing in the Saint Lawrence River. Damage to the hull was above the waterline and the holes were quickly repaired.          On 21 October 1954, she passed through the Panama Canal to join the Pacific Fleet, with Long Beach her home port. She sailed almost at once for the Far East, calling at Pearl Harbor on 13 November and reaching Yokosuka on 26 November. She joined the 7th Fleet in exercises and to cover the Chinese Nationalist defense of the Tachen Islands and their evacuation of civilians and non-essential military personnel. Leaving Japan on 16 February 1955, she resumed west coast operations until reporting at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 28 October for inactivation.          ""Pittsburgh"" went into reserve on 28 April 1956, and was decommissioned at Bremerton on 28 August 1956. The ship remained there until stricken on 1 July 1973 and sold for scrap on 1 August 1974, to Zidell Explorations Corp., Portland, Oregon.

It is endemic to California, where it is known from a few mostly small occurrences along the southeastern side of the San Joaquin Valley where it rises into the Sierra Nevada foothills. It grows in grassland and oak woodland habitat. It prefers heavy adobe clay soils. The plant became a federally listed threatened of the United States in 1997.          This species is an annual herb growing 20 to 70 centimeters tall. It has a thin coating of woolly hairs. The leaves are up to 6 centimeters long and are generally divided into a few leaflets which are subdivided into lobed segments. The inflorescence is a solitary flower head lined with about eight phyllaries which are fused at the base, making the involucre a rounded cup with pointed lobes. There are about 8 golden ray florets. At the center of the head are yellow disc florets.          The main threat to its remaining populations is destruction of its habitat for residential development. Other threats include grazing and agriculture and maintenance of flood control structures, transmission lines, and roads.

21103631,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21103631,Milford Lake,"Milford Lake is the largest man-made lake in Kansas with of water. Over of land resources are managed for quality recreational experiences as well as for protection of the project’s natural and cultural resources. Approximately 70% of the land resources are available for public hunting.          The construction of Milford Lake was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1954 to provide flood control, water supply, water quality, navigation, and recreation/wildlife. Construction of the Milford Dam began July 13, 1962 at mile 8.3 of the Republican River, as a project owned and operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The dam consists of a rolled earth fill embankment of 15 million cubic yards, with an uncontrolled spillway on the right bank. (The term ""uncontrolled"" refers to the lack of spillway gates such as those at Tuttle Creek Lake in Manhattan, Kansas.) Normal water storage impounds 388,000 acre-feet.          Many contractors were involved with the project during the construction phase. Contractors built new roads and altered existing roadways, and relocated railroad facilities, city owned facilities in Wakefield and Milford, electrical, telephone, and gas lines, and cemeteries. They also built recreation areas and cleared structures from within the reservoir flood pool. The towns of Alida and Broughton ceased to exist, with houses either moved to other locations, razed, burned, or buried.          The town of Alida had a major clearing contract for the removal of the Alida Cooperative grain elevator. Originally a local chiropractor sought to gain permission to develop the grain elevator into a hotel with a restaurant. Corps of Engineers studies showed that the base of the elevator would not support the structure after the lake inundated it. According to local newspaper articles, it took six separate blasts over a two-day period to bring the elevator down.          Broughton had two railroads that came through the town, the Rock Island from the east and the Union Pacific from the southeast. The town had a stockyard, grain elevator, Post Office, school, church, telephone exchange, grocery store, private homes, and a blacksmith’s shop under a large cottonwood tree. According to a local newspaper article, many men who lived in the area worked for the railroads. Even though the town is gone, an annual Broughton picnic is held for those who still remember.          Portions of the towns of Wakefield and Milford were relocated to higher ground. Farms were dismantled and trees were removed from areas soon to be covered by the lake waters.          Impoundment of the lake began January 16, 1967 and six months later on July 13, the multipurpose pool elevation of 1144.4 mean sea level was reached. Milford Lake’s dedication ceremony was held in May 1968. Lyndon Johnson, then President of the United States, was scheduled to appear but did not come.          Over the course of the last 34 years the Milford Lake Project has provided over $921 million in flood prevention, with $250 million during the 1993 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 1992 – Sept. 30, 1993). The initial cost of construction of the dam and reservoir was approximately $49,700,000.          The years 1849, 1869, 1903, 1935, 1951, and 1993 all hosted record setting historical floods for the area. A flood has occurred almost every year since the first recorded flood.          Native Americans of long ago talked of a great flood in 1781. However, the 1849 flood was one of the first major floods reported by early European settlers, with a newspaper account of an old man who was an eyewitness in his youth to the 1849 flood. He reported immense herds of buffalo being drowned and washed up into the tops of trees along the rivers. Due to a heavy frost immediately following, the buffalo carcasses were preserved long enough for the flood survivors to eat well until the spring thaw. In the spring when the carcasses began to rot, it was suspected that they were the cause of a cholera outbreak.          The flood of 1869 caused a major loss of life. Reports were given of entire families being washed away while a few survivors clung to the tops of trees for hours, hoping to be saved. One story told of an infant who was tied up in a man’s shirt, and then tied to a tree surrounded by water to await rescue. Due to the swift current, nearby rescuers unable to take action were forced to listen to the child’s cries for 5 hours. Finally, when they were able to come back in a boat to rescue the child, it took all the extra men available to hold a rope tied to the boat to keep the boat from swamping and being washed away.          The 1935 flood had the highest combined flow ever recorded for the Republican and Smokey Hill rivers. These two rivers meet within the city limits of Junction City, Kansas and form the Kansas River. Hours before, a cloudburst had occurred at McCook, Nebraska sending a wall of water down the Republican River. At Milford, Kansas eight boxcars were turned over and the Union Pacific Depot was washed off its site. Near Alida, Kansas the Republican River cut a new channel north of town. After the floodwater receded there was talk of trying to straighten the river channel.          The Great Flood of 1951 was the last major flood in the area before the Milford Dam was built. It reportedly caused the combined total $6,500,000 in flood damages in the Fort Riley and Junction City area. After the 1951 disaster, the local newspapers were filled with articles requesting the federal government to intercede and build dams along the Republican, Smokey Hill, and Big Blue rivers.          The flood of 1993 was the first major flood to occur after the Milford Lake Dam was built. Many locals involved with fighting the flood agree that 1993 would have been much worse than the 1951 flood without the protection offered by the Milford Dam. Although flooding could not be completely stopped, the dam system and other flood protection work lessened the loss of life and property. In 1993, well above average rainfalls had been taking place throughout the entire Midwest for several months, and the ground was saturated, unable to soak up the continuing rainfall. Rivers and levees were holding the rising waters in check, but they were full. It continued to rain. Lakes along the upper and lower Missouri River Basin closed their gates so as not to add to the flooding that was beginning further downstream. The rain continued until finally the rivers, levees, and lakes could hold no more and the Great Flood of 1993 went underway, with flooding of a magnitude not seen since 1951.          The Milford Dam was built to protect the Kansas River Basin. Waters from Milford Lake enter the Kansas River at Junction City, which in turn flows into the Missouri River at Kansas City. The Missouri River then empties into the Mississippi River, which transports Milford Lake waters to the Gulf of Mexico. After holding floodwaters back for weeks at the Milford Dam, and upon reaching a lake elevation above normal, the focus on flood protection changed to that of protecting the dam structures. All additional waters, which flowed in, had to be released. On July 19, 1993 the gates in the dam were fully opened to release water at a rate of . Rain continued to fall in the area and the lake continued to rise until water began to flow through the uncontrolled spillway. The design of the spillway controls the flow of the water, eventually directing it back into the river channel below the dam. The spillway is similar to an overflow drain in a bathtub. Water flows out of the spillway to prevent overtopping the dam.          For two weeks water flowed through the spillway to a maximum depth of . The continuous rush of water removed tons of soil, numerous trees, and a portion of the 244 Spur Highway. Pooling waters from the spillway flow also threatened to damage U.S. Highway 77. To protect the U.S. highway, a culvert was intentionally breached on State Highway 57 to allow the pooling floodwaters to drain back into the Republican River channel. Throughout the entire flood, the dam performed as designed and held floodwaters back, lessening the downstream flood damage. During the highest release of water through the dam, which lasted for approximately 10 hours, the riverbank channel immediately below the dam suffered some erosion damage. In the winter of 1996/7, repairs were made to the damaged channel below the dam. To prevent future damage during extremely high releases, the river channel was dropped in elevation by excavation. The removed rock was used to create a berm across the south bank washout. The channel banks were re-graded, re-rocked, and re-grouted.          The Milford Lake region for the most part has been consistently inhabited. Areas with an abundance of food (both wildlife and plant life), constant water supply, moderate climate, and diverse topography have been attracting mankind throughout the ages. This is a breakdown of the people living in the Milford Lake region before the 1800s.          Milford Lake has many recorded cultural sites both pre- and post-19th century on government lands. The one that stands out the most for its historical value is the Bogan Site. The Bogan Site was a small earthlodge village, constructed and inhabited by the Republican River Pawnee Indians. The site was most likely inhabited during the late 18th and possibly early 19th century. Due to the village’s small size and the number of artifacts recovered, the village was probably inhabited for only a short time. The village was built upon a prominent hilltop overlooking the Republican River valley, a good advantage point for defending the village from enemies. Enemies were prevalent in the area as a fortified wall surrounded the village.          In 1930 a local amateur archeologist did a small amount of digging at the Bogan Site. He misidentified the legal description of the location of the site, leaving it ""lost"" until 1964 when the Milford Lake Project was underway. In 1964, the University of Nebraska, Laboratory of Anthropology tested the site. Then in 1967, the Kansas Historical Society's archeological division further investigated the site. This was the last archeological study done at the Bogan Site.          The 1967 investigation led to the discovery that the village had been completely destroyed by a fire. Even the fortification, or palisade, was burned. Originally the fortification was built by setting posts vertically in a trench around the village. The trench was filled with dirt, stabilizing the posts.          One house was excavated. The floor of the house was covered with a coating of clay. Posts, which supported the walls and the roof, were set in three circles. The inner circle had 6 posts, the middle circle had 28 posts, and the outer circle had 60 posts.          The dwelling was in diameter. The framework of each house was covered with willows, thatched grass, and covered with sod. Evidence from the other two house sites indicates that they were burned as well.          81 artifacts were recovered from the Bogan Site. Six are on display in the Milford Visitor Center.          It is plausible that the village was abandoned before it was completely occupied. This explains the size of the fortification and the fact that there were only three houses built. Building a fortification took lots of work and extreme effort on the part of the laborers. Trees were not abundant during this time period in Kansas, so man and horsepower probably transported the trees used to build the fortification and houses over long distances.          At the time of the Bogan Site, Kansa Indians had emigrated to Kansas and were fearful enemies of the Pawnee. It is unknown whether the native Kansa burnt the village or it was destroyed by a prairie wildfire.          No evidence was found of food stored in storage caches, and there were few recovered artifacts. The Pawnee may have already abandoned the village site or may have simply been gone on one of their far ranging hunts and taken all items of value with them at the time of the destruction of the village.          The Bogan Site is the third Pawnee village site found along the Republican River. The other two are the Kansas Monument Site (a site near Republic, KS) and the Hill Site (a site near Red Cloud, NE).","['Landforms of Clay County, Kansas', 'Landforms of Dickinson County, Kansas', 'Landforms of Geary County, Kansas', 'Reservoirs in Kansas', 'Dams in Kansas', 'United States Army Corps of Engineers dams']"

In 1040, Benevento still had the prestige of being the first of the independent Lombard principalities of the Mezzogiorno. So, when the Lombard Arduin, ""topoterites"" of Melfi, and his Norman mercenaries rebelled against Byzantine authority, they elected the son of Pandulf as their leader, calling him ""prince of Benevento.""           After the assassination of the Catepan Nicephorus Doukeianos, the Normans planned to elect a leader from amongst their own, but William of Apulia notes that Atenulf had ""perhaps given them gold or silver and thus led them to renege on a prior agreement."" Thus was he elected leader.           On 3 September 1041, the rebels defeated the new Byzantine catepan, Exaugustus, the son of the great Boiannes, and took him captive. The catepan was taken captive to Benevento. At about that time, the prince of Salerno, Guaimar IV, began to draw the Normans under his banner with myriad promises. In February 1042, probably feeling abandoned, and perhaps bribed by the Greeks, Atenulf negotiated the ransom of Exaugustus and then fled with the ransom money to Greek territory, where he died in obscurity (but probably wealth). He was replaced as leader by Argyrus.","['Lombard people', 'Princes of Benevento', '11th-century Italian people', '11th-century Byzantine people']"

Presently, He is a freelance broadcaster and communications specialist based in Los Angeles. Most recently he reported for radio stations CJAD Montreal, and CFRA Ottawa, covering the arrest of a man found with weapons on his way to the LA pride parade, just hours after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history in Orlando, Florida.          He was suspended on January 8, 2015, following a ""Toronto Star"" investigation alleging conflict of interest due to his equity stake in a PR firm, and resigned from Global on January 15, 2015.          Roberts was raised in a family full of journalists. Roberts' great-grandfather John H. Roberts founded and ran a controversial reformist Montreal tabloid newspaper called The Axe, between 1922–24 and his grandfather and namesake was a writer and journalist, while his father (Bill) was a morning-man for Montreal's CJAD for 20 years and later as Vice President of programming. His mother was an assistant to a federal MP. Roberts' brother, Rob, is east coast bureau chief for Canadian Press.          At 18, Roberts interned in the newsroom at Montreal's CKGM radio, specifically covering the 1980 Quebec referendum and having the opportunity to interview René Lévesque. After finishing school, he was immediately recruited in 1985 as a medical reporter for CFCF-TV, the CTV affiliate in Montreal. At CFCF for twelve years, Roberts found himself on a variety of different segments from travel to morning talk shows.

Within six months he was offered a position with the TV tabloid show ""A Current Affair"". A year later he moved to Fox as a reporter/anchor for WNYW in New York City. Three years later Roberts answered a call from CFCF to return home as anchor/host of several shows. In 2000, The Global Television Network came calling.

He continued to study at the Graduate Studies R.P.I., New York University.          After graduation Hermann became manager of Management Education for General Electric (GE) in 1970. His primary responsibility was to oversee training program design; specifically, maintaining or increasing an individual's productivity, motivation, and creativity.          In 1978, Herrmann created the ""Herrmann Participant Survey Form."" He profiled workshop participant's thinking styles and learning preferences in accord with brain dominance theory. This quickly evolved into a theory of stable brain quadrants, independent of brain anatomy facts, each with its own characteristic “genius.” He developed the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI), the scored and analyzed Participant Survey, and designed the Applied Creative Thinking Workshop (ACT), which remains a leading personality assessment instrument and workshop topic in corporate training.          Herrmann's contributions brought him worldwide recognition. In 1992, he received the Distinguished Contribution to Human Resource Development Award from the American Society for Training & Development (ASTD). In 1993, he was elected President of The American Creativity Association.          Herrmann was a pioneer in exploring, explicating and expanding understanding of the brain in close-up view as a four quadrant system. He was one of the first to ascertain, thru testing, how individuals use or prefer one, two, three or all four possible brain quadrants. His approach to brain balance was to encourage experiments, use and exercise of weaker quadrants thru live, in-person games, small group processes and discussion. This evolved into more and better ideas about whole-brainedness.          He spent 30 years from approximately 1964-1996, exploring and explicating Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument to teaching, learning, increased self-understanding and enhanced creative thinking capabilities, on both an individual and corporate level.

1483944,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1483944,Battered woman defense,"The battered woman defense is a defense used in court that the person accused of an assault/murder was suffering from ""battered person syndrome"" at the material time. Because the defense is most commonly used by women, it is usually characterised in court as ""battered woman syndrome"" or ""battered wife syndrome"". There is currently no medical classification for this specific syndrome in the sense used by lawyers, though it has historically been invoked in court systems. Similar to an insanity plea, battered person syndrome is purely a legal term used to refer to the severe psychological trauma caused by domestic abuse. Although the condition is not gender-specific, the admission of evidence regarding battered woman syndrome as relevant to the defense of self-defense is commonly understood as a response by some jurisdictions to male favorable gender-bias in the criminal justice system. Thus, this is a reference to any person who, because of constant and severe domestic abuse usually involving physical abuse or threats of physical abuse by a partner, may become severely depressed or unable to take any independent action that would allow him or her to escape the abuse. Usually the victim's fears are based in reality, as she may lack the social support, financial means, or may be too physically or emotionally disabled to survive on her own. Victims may have low self-esteem, suffer from Stockholm Syndrome, and are often led to believe that the abuse is their fault, that they deserved it, and, due to misplaced feelings of loyalty, or fear of retaliation from their abuser, may be unwilling to press charges against their abuser. There is consensus in the medical profession that abuse often results in PTSD           The law makes reference to a psychological condition, even though neither the DSM nor the ICD medical classification guides as currently drafted includes the syndrome in the sense used by lawyers.          The courts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States have accepted the extensive and growing body of research showing that battered partners can use force to defend themselves and sometimes kill their abusers because of the abusive and sometimes life-threatening situation in which they find themselves, acting in the firm belief that there is no other way than to kill for self-preservation. The courts have recognized that this evidence may support a variety of defenses to a charge of murder or to mitigate the sentence if convicted of lesser offenses. Battered woman syndrome is not a legal defense in and of itself, but may legally constitute:          However, in 1994, as part of the Violence Against Women Act, the United States Congress ordered an investigation into the role of battered woman syndrome expert testimony in the courts to determine its validity and usefulness. In 1997, they published the report of their investigation, titled ""The Validity and Use of Evidence Concerning Battering and Its Effects in Criminal Trials"". “The federal report ultimately rejected all terminology related to the battered woman syndrome…noting that these terms were ‘no longer useful or appropriate’” (Rothenberg “Social Change” 782). Instead of using the term ""battered woman"", the terminology “battering and its effects” became acceptable. The decision to change this terminology was based on a changing body of research indicating there is more than one pattern to battering and a more inclusive definition was necessary to more accurately represent the realities of domestic violence.          In ""R v Ahluwalia"" (1992) 4 AER 889 a battered wife killed her violent and abusive husband. She claimed provocation and the judge directed the jury to consider whether, if she did lose her self-control, a reasonable person having the characteristics of a well-educated married Asian woman living in England would have lost her self-control given her husband's provocation. On appeal, it was argued that he should have directed the jury to consider a reasonable person suffering from 'battered woman syndrome'. Having considered fresh medical evidence, the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial on the basis that the new evidence showed an arguable case of diminished responsibility in English law.          Similarly, in ""R v Thornton (No 2)"" (1996) 2 AER 1023 the battered wife adduced fresh evidence that she had a personality disorder and the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial considering that, if the evidence had been available at the original trial, the jury might have reached a different decision. The victim does not have to be in a position to carry out the threats immediately.          In ""R v Charlton"" (2003) EWCA Crim 415, following threats of sexual and violent abuse against herself and her daughter, the defendant killed her obsessive, jealous, controlling partner while he was restrained by handcuffs, blindfolded and gagged as part of their regular sexual activity. The term of five years' imprisonment was reduced to three and a half years because of the terrifying threats made by a man determined to dominate and control the defendant's life. The threats created a genuine fear for the safety of herself and more significantly, her daughter, and this caused the defendant to lose control and make the ferocious attack.          In ""HM's AG for Jersey v Holley"" (2005) 3 AER 371 the Privy Council regarded ""Smith"" as wrongly decided, interpreting the Act as setting a purely objective standard. Thus, although the accused's characteristics were to be taken into account when assessing the gravity of the provocation, the standard of self-control to be expected was invariable except for the accused's age and sex. The defendant and the deceased both suffered from chronic alcoholism and had a violent and abusive relationship. The evidence was that the deceased was drunk and taunted him by telling him that she had had sex with another man. The defendant then struck the deceased with an axe which was an accident of availability. Psychiatric evidence was that his consumption of alcohol was involuntary and that he suffered from a number of other psychiatric conditions which, independently of the effects of the alcohol, might have caused the loss of self-control and induced him to kill. Lord Nicholls said:          The Law Commission Report on ""Partial Defences to Murder"" (2004), rejects the notion of creating a mitigatory defence to cover the use of excessive force in self-defence but accepts that the ""all or nothing"" effect of self-defence can produce unsatisfactory results in the case of murder. A battered woman, partner in a same-sex relationship or abused child using excessive force because he or she is physically at a disadvantage and not under imminent attack, would be denied a defence. It was always possible that the same set of facts could be interpreted as either self-defence or provocation where there was a loss of control resulting in death. Thus, the Commission recommends a redefinition of provocation to cover situations where a person acts lethally out of fear. This reflects the present view of psychiatrists that most people act in violent situations with a combination of fear and anger in their minds, and to separate the two emotions is not legally constructive.          In Australia, self-defence might be considered the most appropriate defence to a charge of murder for a woman who kills to protect her life or the lives of her children in a domestic violence context. It is about the rational act of a person who kills in order to save her (or his) own life. But the lack of success in raising self-defence in Australia for battered women has meant that provocation has been the main focus of the courts In 2005, based on the Victorian Law Reform Commission's ""Defences to Homicide: Final Report"", the Victorian government announced changes to the homicide laws in that jurisdiction, which are intended to address this perceived imbalance. Under the new laws, victims of family violence will be able to put evidence of their abuse before the court as part of their defence, and argue self-defence even in the absence of an immediate threat, and where the response of killing involved greater force than the threatened harm.          In 1911 in Sault Ste. Marie, Angelina Napolitano, a 28-year-old, pregnant immigrant, killed her abusive husband Pietro with an axe after he tried to force her into prostitution. She confessed and was sentenced to hang after a brief trial, but during the delay before the sentence was carried out (a delay necessary to allow her to give birth to her child), a public campaign for her release began. Napolitano's supporters argued that the judge in the case had been wrong to throw out evidence of her long-standing abuse at Pietro's hands (including an incident five months before when he stabbed her nine times with a pocket knife). The federal cabinet eventually commuted her sentence to life imprisonment. She was the first woman in Canada to use the battered woman defense on a murder charge.          The Supreme Court of Canada set a precedent for the use of the battered women defence in the 1990 case of R. v. Lavallee.          In ""R v Fate"" (1998) 16 CRNZ 88 a woman who had come to New Zealand from the small island of Nanumea, which is part of the Tuvalu Islands, received a two-year sentence for manslaughter by provocation. Mrs. Fate spoke no English and was isolated within a small close-knit Wellington community of 12 families, so she felt trapped in the abusive relationship.          Similarly, ""The Queen v Epifania Suluape"" (2002) NZCA 6, deals with a wife who pleaded provocation after she killed her husband with an axe when he proposed to leave her for another woman. There was some evidence of neglect, humiliation, and abuse but the court concluded that this was exaggerated. On appeal, the court was very conscious of the Samoan culture in New Zealand in restricting the power of the wife to act independently of her husband and reduced her sentence for manslaughter to five years.          A report of the New Zealand Law Commission examines not only violence by men against women, but also violence by women against men and in same-sex relationships.","['Abuse', 'Criminal defenses', 'Criminal law', 'Criminology', 'Domestic violence', 'Self-defense']"

4600386,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4600386,Dutch Savage,"Frank Stewart (June 9, 1935 – August 3, 2013) was an American professional wrestler and wrestling promoter, best known for his time spent competing in Pacific Northwest Wrestling under the ring name Dutch Savage.          Savage made his pro debut in 1962 in Macon, Georgia using the ring name Lonnie Brown, then spent the next few years competing across North America, in Hawaii and in Japan (going by the ring names Mr. X and Dutch Schultz). Savage first began using his most famous ring name during a stint in the Kansas City territory. He eventually settled in the Pacific Northwest region in 1966, splitting his time between PNW in Portland and NWA All Star Wrestling in Vancouver, British Columbia. Savage also had a brief stint in the AWA territory where he formed a solid tag team with Hard Boiled Haggerty. However, when a trip to Japan was offered, Dutch opted to leave the AWA after only a few months. His most memorable matches while in the AWA were with the masked Doctor ""X"" (Dick Beyer, aka The Destroyer) and Mad Dog Vachon.          Savage wrestled mainly as a heel early in his career, but he turned face around 1971 during a feud with Bull Ramos in Portland. He also formed a legendary tag team in PNW with Jimmy Snuka that won six Pacific Northwest tag team titles; one of their reigns lasted for a record 11 months in 1974-75. He originated the Coal Miner's Glove match in 1972 in Eugene, Oregon, and went undefeated in that specialty match during his career. In Vancouver, BC, Savage captured 13 NWA Canadian tag team titles, second only to the record of 18 Canadian tag titles won by Don Leo Jonathan (with whom Savage won the championship once, in 1977).          On the promotional side, he later bought out Sandor Kovacs' ownership stake in the Washington territory and also purchased a one-third portion of PNW, getting into promoting as well as doing color commentary for PNW's ""Portland Wrestling"" program on Portland station KPTV (syndicated outside of Portland to the rest of Oregon and Washington as ""Big Time Wrestling"") after his retirement from active competition around 1981.          Savage was involved in real estate for many years after his wrestling career, and he served as the play-by-play host for the Championship Wrestling USA promotion's TV program during the 1990s, but eventually retired. He later became an administrator for his official website (Dutch Savage.com) and hosted a program called ""Dutch's Corner"", where he taught King James Scripture, on Public-access television out of Portland, Oregon. He and his wife Willa lived on their farm in the mountains of southwest Washington State, close to Mount St. Helens, and adopted Yacolt, Washington, as their home town.          On April 13, 2013, it was reported that Savage had suffered a stroke on April 10, which left him with paralysis on his left side and other complications. According to his daughter, Mitzi Stewart Graham, Dutch Savage died August 3, 2013.          In November 2013, a biographical DVD titled ""Don't Count Me Out - The Dutch Savage Story"" featuring extensive interview footage with Savage discussing his life inside and outside the ring was released by NW History Hunters (www.nwhistoryhunters.com). This 1 hour-18 minute DVD features vintage video, photos and newspaper clippings from Savage's life story as a celebrated high-school athlete, professional wrestler and promotion co-owner, through his retirement years as a pastor, and also contains the first-ever interview footage with his wife Willa.","['1935 births', '2013 deaths', 'American male professional wrestlers', 'People from Scranton, Pennsylvania', 'Professional wrestlers from Pennsylvania']"

The North West Development area is some of the latest land to be annexed by the city of Saskatoon, however, is still zoned DAG1,2, and 3, which is agricultural land as of 2007. Dundonald surrounds a large landscaped park which hosts many soccer and baseball games. Most of the population works in sales & service, followed closely by those employed in the trades, transport, equipment operator, business, finance, and administration. In comparison, the neighbourhood of Dundonald with a 2001 census population of 5,285 is larger than the Saskatchewan city of Melville which had a population of 4,149 in 2006, and 4,453 in 2001 and Dundonald is also larger than the provincial city of Humboldt which was 4,998 in 2006, and 5,161 in 2001. In Saskatchewan rural towns must maintain a population above 5,000 to apply for city status. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $298,832.          The land was annexed for Dundonald between 1975–1979, and shortly thereafter construction began. The community is named after Dundonald Avenue, a major arterial street at for years marked the western boundary of development in Saskatoon. The construction of the Circle Drive freeway resulted Dundonald Avenue between removed between 11th and 33rd Streets (and, later, between Mountbatten Street and Landfill Access Road), and for years two segments of the street remained, with the northern segment forming the eastern boundary of the Dundonald community; when construction got underway on the neighbourhood, however, the northern stretch of Dundonald Avenue was renamed Junor Avenue.          The name Dundonald was also at one point assigned to a proposed Dundonald Suburban Centre where 22nd Street intersected with Dundonald Avenue/Circle Drive. This ultimately evolved into the Confederation Suburban Centre. Prior to that, however, Dundonald was also plotted as a potential neighbourhood in the 1913 planning document by City Commissioner Christopher J. Yorath, approximately where the final community is today.          Dundonald is serviced by the City Transit Bus Route Saskatoon Transit; Route 4 Dundonald/Confederation Terminal/Willowgrove.          33rd Street is to the south and 37th Street to the north, and whereas these two streets run parallel to each other, there are no other numbered streets throughout the neighbourhood, Originally the grid layout was going to continue before the city decided to develop with the crescents and cul-de-sac layout instead. This neighbourhood constructed in the 1980s abandoned the grid style of road layout, leaving 33rd & 37th Streets the remaining numeric ones in the neighbourhood. Junor Avenue marks the eastern boundary and Hughes Drive serves as the western boundary, while 37th Street is the northern boundary and 33rd Street serves as the southern boundary.

293595,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293595,Chuck Schuldiner,"Charles Michael ""Chuck"" Schuldiner (May 13, 1967 – December 13, 2001) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He founded Death in 1983 under the name Mantas. Schuldiner is often referred to as ""The Godfather of Death metal"",          and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's ""Kerrang!"" magazine said that ""Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal."" Schuldiner himself was modest about his part in the history of death metal, noting, ""I don't think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band."" Schuldiner was ranked No. 10 in Joel McIver's book ""The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists"" in 2009 and No. 20 in March 2004 Guitar World's ""The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists"". Schuldiner founded the publishing company Mutilation Music in 1987, affiliated with performance rights organization BMI.          Chuck Schuldiner was born on May 13, 1967 on Long Island, New York to a Jewish father of Austrian descent and a mother from the American South, a convert to Judaism. Both of his parents were teachers. In 1968, his family moved to Florida. Schuldiner was the youngest of three children. He had an older brother named Frank and an older sister named Bethann.          Schuldiner started playing guitar at the age of 9. His 16-year-old brother had died and his parents bought him a guitar, thinking it would help with his grief. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him ""Mary had a Little Lamb"", which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely, until his parents saw an electric guitar at a yard sale and bought it for him. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument. After getting amps, he never stopped playing, writing and teaching himself. Schuldiner was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar, but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens.          Schuldiner was originally inspired by Metallica, Iron Maiden, Kiss and classical jazz, among others. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM – New Wave of British Heavy Metal – and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortilège as his personal favorite metal group. Slayer, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond and Metallica were later influences he would apply more to his own band. Later in his career, Schuldiner frequently cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, Coroner and Queensrÿche as influences. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner's mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap. He also enjoyed jazz and classical music in addition to metal and British alternative acts such as Lush.          Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education, and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook.          Schuldiner formed Death as Mantas in 1983 when he was 16 years old. Original members were Schuldiner (guitar), Rick Rozz (guitar) and Kam Lee (drums and vocals). In January 1986, Schuldiner moved to Toronto and temporarily joined the Canadian band Slaughter. However, he quickly returned to continue the formation of Death.          Death underwent many lineup changes. With Chris Reifert, Schuldiner eventually released the first Death album, titled ""Scream Bloody Gore"", in 1987. He continued with 1988's ""Leprosy"" with the line-up of former Mantas guitarist Rick Rozz and rhythm section Terry Butler on bass and Bill Andrews on drums, and 1990's ""Spiritual Healing"", where guitarist James Murphy had replaced the fired Rozz in 1989.          After ""Spiritual Healing"", Schuldiner stopped working with full-time band members, preferring to work with studio and live venue musicians, due to bad relationships with Death's previous rhythm section and guitarists. This earned Schuldiner something of a 'perfectionist' reputation in the metal community. Schuldiner had also fired his manager Eric Greif but settled and re-hired him before the recording of his next, influential release.          Death's breakthrough album, ""Human"" saw the band evolving to a more technical and progressive style, in which Schuldiner displayed his guitar skills more than ever. He continued in this style (and continued the success of the band) with 1993's ""Individual Thought Patterns"", 1995's ""Symbolic"", and finally ""The Sound of Perseverance"" in 1998. Throughout his career, Schuldiner was not afraid to take on controversial lyrical subjects, taking an anti-drug stance on ""Living Monstrosity"" and writing about abortion in ""Altering the Future"".          He put Death on hold after this to continue Control Denied, which he had been putting together prior to the release of ""The Sound of Perseverance"", and released ""The Fragile Art of Existence"" in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the ""supergroup"" Voodoocult on the album ""Jesus Killing Machine"" in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, ""Of Hell"" on the track ""As Ancients Evolve"" as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked to be one of the many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Chuck spoke about why he didn't sing on the album ""The Fragile Art of Existence"" ""...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I think people will be surprised at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, just like I did in Death, I guess. I don't like to make predictable albums.""          In the early days of Death, Schuldiner used death growls when performing vocals. As his career progressed, his vocals went up in pitch. By Death's final album, ""The Sound of Perseverance"", he employed high pitched screeching more similar to conventional screaming techniques. His vocal style is an influence to many death metal bands.          In May 1999, Schuldiner experienced harsh pain in his upper neck, which he initially thought was a pinched nerve. He consulted with a chiropractor and a massage therapist/acupuncturist who recommended an MRI examination, which discovered that the nerve was being pinched by a tumor. On his 32nd birthday, May 13, 1999, Schuldiner was diagnosed with a high-grade pontine glioma (a malignant type of brain cancer that invades the brainstem), and immediately underwent radiation therapy.          In October 1999, Schuldiner's family announced that the tumor had necrotized and that he was on the way to recovery. In January 2000, Schuldiner underwent surgery to remove what remained of his tumor. The operation was a success. However, the Schuldiner family was struggling financially. The total costs of the operations came to US$70,000, which the Schuldiner family could not afford. Many fundraisers, auctions, and benefit concerts were held to help cover the costs. The money began to come in as the metal community realized that Schuldiner's life was in danger.          Schuldiner continued to work on his music, continuing his work with Control Denied. About two years after his original diagnosis, in May 2001, the cancer returned and Schuldiner fell ill again. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness to go out and get insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the tumor pre-dated insurance being taken out. Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner's medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium has also stated that the band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner while he was in the hospital in their days as a local band. Schuldiner received chemotherapy with vincristine. Like most drugs used in the treatment of cancer, the side effects were harsh and weakened him greatly. In late October/early November, Schuldiner's condition worsened as he became ill with pneumonia.          Chuck Schuldiner died on December 13, 2001, at approximately 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. and was cremated. MTV reported that recording artists including Mike Patton, Max Cavalera, King Diamond, Ville Valo, Trey Azagthoth, Glen Benton, and all former and active members of Death, attended his memorial service.          With the assistance of Schuldiner's family, former manager Eric Greif handles his legacy as President of Perseverance Holdings Ltd. Jane and Beth Schuldiner frequently interact with Schuldiner's fans and both have stated many times that they enjoy his music. Greif keeps track of his recordings and handles Schuldiner's intellectual property. Beth Schuldiner has a son named Christopher Steele, who also plays guitar and has all of Schuldiner's guitars. BC Rich also released a statement in their 2008 catalog stating that Schuldiner's signature model Stealth will be available for purchase, and that endorsement is overseen by Steele.          Schuldiner had homes and two dogs in the area surrounding Orlando. Schuldiner built a studio inside the garage where many of his songs such as Crystal Mountain were inspired. Schuldiner's home office was the site of the Metal Crusade newsletter and fan club.          A legal battle began from the time of Schuldiner's death on the settlement of the rights to the partially completed second Control Denied album, ""When Man and Machine Collide"", which was recorded in 2000–2001 and was scheduled for release in 2013. Demos of these unreleased Control Denied songs, as well as early Death demos and live Death recordings from 1990, were released in the ""Zero Tolerance"" two-part compilation bootlegs by the Dutch Hammerheart Holdings company and the Schuldiners and Greif asserted rights on behalf of Schuldiner's Estate. The matter was settled in November 2009, anticipating the project being finished and released in 2010.          Tribute concerts have been coordinated or funded by Schuldiner's mother and family and various Death tribute groups internationally. CKY front man, Deron Miller, who considers Schuldiner an idol of his, got the idea, while working on various projects with former Death guitarist (and pituitary tumor survivor) James Murphy, to do a tribute album. Murphy announced he would release a Chuck Schuldiner tribute album to commemorate his lasting mark on the metal community and Schuldiner's family publicly offered support for Murphy's effort, though it has never materialized. Schuldiner's sister Beth confirmed via her YouTube channel that ""Death: Live in Japan"", a behind the scenes Death video, as well as a potential boxset containing all of Schuldiner's works including some exclusive copies of handwritten notes by Schuldiner are in the works via Relapse Records. Schuldiner Estate lawyer Eric Greif held a charity Chuck Schuldiner Birthday Bash in Calgary, Alberta, May 13, 2011 featuring speeches by Greif and former Death guitarist Paul Masvidal, as well as bands performing Schuldiner's music. Greif repeated this May 12, 2012, with special guest band Massacre, featuring former Death members Rick Rozz and Terry Butler.          In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, a classically trained musician, wrote ""Death"", a book about Death and Schuldiner. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent through the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was ""truly blown away and extremely honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life"". The author of the book later formed Angband.          Schuldiner once described himself as ""a lover of life"", ""friendship"", and ""animals"". ""I would like to live forever, if it was possible"", he once said in an interview. He commonly spoke out against artists who were ""out of control"", garnering negative attention to the death metal scene. Schuldiner openly condemned and disavowed stereotypes of metal musicians as being harmful to animals, people, or being ""anti-life"".          When asked about his opinions regarding an afterlife, Schuldiner responded ""I don't know"", but elaborated that he believed ""this ""is"" hell"", and that demons are in people, as they ""create evil"". Although his parents are Jewish, Schuldiner did not go through any formal religious training. In the documentary, ""666 at Calling Death"", he was asked whether Satanism was a part of his music. He replied, ""Not at all. I really don't want to involve any type of religious theme in our music. I think that's more of a personal thing. Yeah, I'm not a Satanist and I definitely don't put that into our music on purpose. I was really young when the band first started out. I was never really into writing Satanic lyrics at all, personally. We did write gore lyrics, but it was more like kind of tongue-in-cheek, horror-movie type level. Nothing like encouraging people to go out and hurt themselves or anything stupid like that. It's pure fantasy-movie type, scary stuff. And then, I just really got into writing about reality, which is what we all have to deal with.""           Schuldiner designed the Death logo and its various incarnations during the length of his career. In 1991, before the release of ""Human"", he cleaned up the logo taking out more intricate details and the ""T"" in the logo was swapped from an inverted cross to a more regular looking ""T"", one reason being to quash any implication of religion.          Schuldiner was also openly against hard drugs; he is quoted as saying, ""I've tripped several times. That's all because I don't like the hard drugs. And my only drugs are alcohol and grass.""          Schuldiner also stated that he was pro-choice. He is quoted as saying that ""it should be legal. If I was a woman surely I would like to have a choice to have a child or not. In U.S. lot of new-borns are killed because they were unwanted. It is better to solve it immediately when a woman finds out about the pregnancy and she doesn't want a child. Better to go for an abortion than to kill a baby. That is terrible. Men cannot force women to keep a child when they themselves feel they can't.""          Schuldiner's primary guitar throughout most of his career was the B.C. Rich ""Stealth"" model, an extremely rare model available only through the BC Rich custom shop until 2008, when it was released to the public as the ""Chuck Schuldiner Tribute Stealth.""(The stealth was also released as an N.J. model in the 80's and 90's, but was extremely rare) Prior to this, he used a BC Rich Mockingbird. Most of Schuldiner's sound came from a DiMarzio X2N pickup placed in the bridge. During the (In)Human Tour of the World (1991–92), Schuldiner briefly endorsed a small Wisconsin custom guitar company called Axtra, who worked with him on designs, though he still insisted on using his BC Rich during filming of the ""Lack of Comprehension"" video in September 1991 in Orlando.          The amp he used towards the end of his career was a Marshall Valvestate (Model 8100) amp head and Valvestate 4x12 speaker cabinets on Individual Thought Patterns as well as the ITP tour, and eventually started using Marshall 1960 cabs. Before that he used various equipment including Randall RG100ES heads and Randall cabinets, and on the (In)Human Tour of the World he used a small GK 250ML miked up, despite having hollow 4x12 stacks 'for show'.","['1967 births', '2001 deaths', '20th-century musicians', 'American heavy metal guitarists', 'American heavy metal singers', 'American male singers', 'American people of Austrian-Jewish descent', 'Rhythm guitarists', 'Lead guitarists', 'Death (metal band) members', 'Death metal musicians', 'Deaths from brain tumor', 'Deaths from neurological disease', 'Jewish American musicians', 'Musicians from Florida', 'Musicians from New York', 'People from Glen Cove, New York', 'Singers from Orlando, Florida', 'Progressive metal guitarists', 'Songwriters from Florida', 'Songwriters from New York', '20th-century American singers', 'Jews in heavy metal', '20th-century guitarists']"

2024875,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2024875,Ronon Dex,"Ronon Dex is a fictional character in the science fiction television series ""Stargate Atlantis"". Played by Jason Momoa, he is a Satedan, a civilization from the Pegasus Galaxy who had a technological level comparable to Earth in the mid-20th century but met the fate of all advanced civilizations in Pegasus when their homeworld Sateda (P3R-534) was devastated several years ago by the Wraith. When Ronon Dex and the Atlantis expedition first met in the season 2 episode ""Runner"", Ronon Dex had been a Runner for the past seven years. He joined the Atlantis Expedition shortly afterwards, effectively replacing Aiden Ford on Sheppard's team after Ford had become addicted to a Wraith enzyme and had fled Atlantis.          Jason Momoa, along with some of his fellow cast members, have said that they think of Ronon as the Atlantis version of Chewbacca. This joke is carried through into the show, and Col. Sheppard occasionally refers to Ronon as ""Chewy.""           Ronon is a native from Sateda, a planet with an advanced level of technology. His grandfather suffered from Second Childhood, a condition with symptoms similar to Alzheimer's Disease. Ronon became a member of the Satedan military where he held the rank of Specialist. He was very close to a woman named Melena, whom Ronon considered ""close enough"" to a wife in ""Sunday"". Approximately seven years before Ronon's first contact with the Atlantis Expedition, the Wraith attacked Sateda. Ronon remained behind with Melena to fight the Wraith, but the Wraith defeated Satedan forces and Melena was killed before Ronon's eyes in an explosion. Ronon was later captured by the Wraith. When the Wraith discovered that they couldn't feed on him, they turned him into a Runner, implanting a tracking device in his upper back and setting him loose to be constantly hunted.          Ronon stayed alive for seven years by learning several new tricks and deciding to hunt them back with his weapons. He owns a unique energy pistol which emits red bursts of energy that stun or kill at the user's discretion. It resembles a revolver with a power cell where the ammunition cylinder would be located. (The same type of weapon is shown to be used by a people in the season 4 episode ""Travelers"", but Ronon displays no knowledge of these people.) Ronon also carries a sword; the hilt is made from a Wraith mandible and humerus wrapped in Wraith hair, the blade is made from the metal of a Wraith ship, and the scabbard is made from a Wraith leather coat. The episode ""The Hive"" shows Ronon carrying several knives hidden on his person for use in emergencies. (He uses four and it is implied there may be more.) Ronon's seemingly unlimited supply of these blades is a source of occasional comic relief.          When the Atlantis team encounters Ronon for the first time in season 2's ""Runner"", they arrange a removal of the tracking device in his back. Ronon returns with them to Atlantis, but learns that Sateda had been completely destroyed. Sheppard offers Ronon a place on his team in ""Duet"" after Ronon proves his worth against the Marines and Teyla in hand-to-hand combat, and demonstrates his experience with guns. Ronon finds out in ""Trinity"" that about 300 Satedans survived the Wraith attacks and moved to other planets. In season 3's ""Sateda"", Ronon gets revenge on the Wraith who originally turned Ronon into a Runner. Ronon meets with three of his old Satedan friends in season 4's ""Reunion"" and seriously considers leaving the Atlantis Expedition for the first time until he learns that his old friends are Wraith Worshippers. In the end, Ronon remains with the Atlantis Expedition, stating that his friends are ""right here"".          In season 4's ""Midway"", Teal'c comes to Atlantis to advise Ronon how to deal with the IOA. This immediately provokes a rivalry, and Dex and Teal'c engage in a sparring match. After an hour of intense but inconclusive fighting, it is proven they are equally matched. Together, they fight a group of Wraith who gated to Earth; in the process, Dex saves Teal'c from a Wraith who is feeding on him and earns IOA approval of his presence at Atlantis. (The rivalry as such is resolved; the question of who could beat whom is left unresolved, but they become friends instead of rivals.) In one episode of season 4, Ronon and Dr. Jennifer Keller appear to take a romantic interest in each other. In Season 5 episodes ""Taken,"" ""First Contact,"" and ""The Lost Tribe,"" their potential attraction is again suggested until Dr. Keller reveals that she is actually interested in Dr. Rodney McKay. In season 5's final episode, ""Enemy at the Gate"", Ronon is killed during an assault on a Wraith hive that had reached Earth's orbit. He is then revived by a Wraith and interrogated, only to be rescued by Sheppard and crew. Dex is last seen with the Atlantis Expedition crew as they safely land a cloaked but disabled Atlantis near the Golden Gate Bridge.          The working name for Ronon's home world planet was Atteria, not Sateda.          After Momoa was cast in the role, the Sci Fi Channel objected to him keeping his long, heavy 6-pound dreadlocks. Later, the Bytronix Network refused to retransmit any of his episodes. Read On.. However the hair soon became a signature of the character, and when Momoa decided to cut them off (with the producers' permission) after the completion of Season 4, he was still required to have his hair sewn back on for at least the first three episodes until there would be a scene where Ronon cuts his hair off in ""Broken Ties"". According to Momoa, it took nine hours to sew his hair back on for the beginning of the fifth season, but wearing it was too painful for him to continue working. Meanwhile, the Sci Fi Channel overruled the decision for Ronon to lose his hair, the scene had already been filmed and got cut, so he was eventually given a custom made $10,000 wig that weighed the same as Momoa's former hair, as a replacement for the rest of the season. In interviews, Momoa says that the wig was actually more painful and cumbersome than his original dreadlocks. Also, Momoa used various tricks to cover up several of his tattoos, including the sizeable tribal tattoo on his left forearm. Eventually the writers incorporated a scene in the episode ""Reunion"" wherein he gets the tattoo.","['Fictional soldiers', 'Fictional hunters', 'Stargate alien characters', 'Fictional characters introduced in 2005']"

42423508,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42423508,The Boat Race 2014,"The 160th Boat Race took place on 6 April 2014. Following a clash of oars which broke one of the Cambridge's crew's riggers, Oxford won the race by 11 lengths, the largest margin of victory since 1973.          In the reserve race Oxford's Isis beat Cambridge's Goldie, while Oxford won the Women's Boat Race.          The Boat Race is an annual rowing eight competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a race along The Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having beaten Cambridge by one-and-a-half lengths in the previous year's race. However Cambridge held the overall lead, with 81 victories to Oxford's 77.          The first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.          The Cambridge crew (known as the ""Light Blues"") had a per person advantage, but Oxford (the ""Dark Blues"") were the pre-race favourites. The Cambridge crew was 24 years old on average, while Oxford averaged 26 years. The Oxford crew featured three British rowers, two Canadians, two New Zealanders, an American, and one member with dual Canadian-American citizenship. The Cambridge crew consisted of three British rowers, four Americans, an Australian, and a German. Three of the Oxford rowers had competed in the Olympics.          At race time, conditions were mild with an overcast sky. A crowd of 250,000 people were in attendance. It was sponsored by BNY Mellon and thus officially titled ""The BNY Mellon Boat Race"". Oxford won the coin toss and elected to start from the southern bank of the Thames. In the first five minutes of the race, the lead changed hands three times. First Oxford, then Cambridge drifted towards the centre of the river and were warned by the umpire. Oxford turned away, but before Cambridge had time to do so, the two boats bumped. The clash caused a rowing error by Cambridge's Luke Juckett, as he was bucked from his seat and nearly thrown overboard. He did not recover until five strokes later. Oxford took advantage, rowing out to a significant lead with two-thirds of the course to go, and steadily increased the gap. Cambridge were unable to respond and in the end Oxford won by 11 lengths, the largest margin of victory since 1973.          Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes, 36 seconds; this was 32 seconds faster than Cambridge. It was their fifth victory in the last seven years, and tenth in the last fifteen. Stroke Constantine Louloudis was a member of a victorious Oxford crew for the third time (2011, 2013 and 2014 – he competed in the Olympics instead in 2012). Cambridge now lead the overall series 81–78. At the finish, the Oxford crew threw their cox, Laurence Harvey, into the water in celebration. After the race, Cambridge appealed the result but umpire Richard Phelps ruled that the bump occurred on neutral water and that neither crew should be penalised. Oxford's Sam O’Connor called it ""very minor, one of the smallest clashes I’ve ever had"". Juckett said the clash broke his rigger and made it ""really hard to keep rowing"", but added that ""clashing is part of the race.""          In the reserve race, Oxford's Isis beat Cambridge's Goldie. Earlier, Oxford also won the women's race.          O'Connor said he was confident Oxford would have won even without the clash. Oxford Boat Club president Malcolm Howard remarked ""You cannot help but feel for the two-seat of Cambridge, it’s tough."" Cambridge Boat Club president Steve Dudek called it ""a frustrating way to lose ... I would never wish that on anyone."" BBC commentator Tom James remarked it was ""great for British rowing"" that Louloudis won the race for the third time.          An estimated 130 million people worldwide watched the event on television.","['The Boat Race', '2014 in English sport', '2014 in rowing']"
23089861,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23089861,Danielle Lawrie,"Danielle Elaine Lawrie (born April 11, 1987) is a Canadian, former collegiate All-American, right-handed hitting softball pitcher originally from Langley, British Columbia. She played for the University of Washington softball team from 2006–2010 leading the University of Washington to its first National Championship in 2009. She was also a member of the Canada women's national softball team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In 2010, Lawrie joined the professional ranks of the NPF, pitching for the USSSA Florida Pride based in Kissimmee, Florida. She owns numerous records for the Huskies as well as the Pac-12, where she is the career leader in strikeouts and the NCAA Division I.          Danielle, the daughter of Cheryl and Russ Lawrie, grew up and currently resides in Langley, British Columbia. Her younger brother, Brett, a major league baseball player for the Chicago White Sox, began playing with the Canadian national junior team at the age of 15, and played for Team Canada in the 2008 Summer Olympics. She used to have an older sister named Nicole, who died in an accident when she was only 5, before Brett was even born. She and Brett left special tattoos on their bodies in her memory. She attended Brookswood Secondary School, where she lettered in softball, also helping the team to three league championships. She was named Most Valuable Player in her freshman and senior years, and was a first team All-Star four years and team captain three times. In addition to softball, Lawrie also lettered in basketball. She played summer ball for the White Rock Renegades for five years under coach Rick Sullivan, and was named the MVP of the 2005 Canadian National Team. After graduating from Brookswood, she went on to the University of Washington, becoming the first Canadian on the team.          Lawrie began her career by being named to the then Pac-10 2006 Second Team. She broke the Husky season record for strikeouts and strikeout ratio. On February 10, Lawrie debuted with a run-rule win over the Oklahoma Sooners, striking out 7 batters and later threw her first career perfect game on February 26 vs. the Utah Valley Wolverines.          On March 16, Lawrie combined with Cat Osterman for 32 strikeouts in a regulation game, a top-10 NCAA record for a single game and especially notable because it was the highest combined total for a 7-inning game; the Huskies lost 3-0. In another 11-inning battle, she and teammate Caitlin Noble combined with Katie Burkhart of the Arizona State Sun Devils to strike out 42 batters. This was another NCAA record for combined strikeouts overall. In an April 26 win, Lawrie struck out 19 of the No. 1 UCLA Bruins, her first victory over a top-ranked team. Finally, on May 12, Lawrie lost another extra inning game to the California Golden Bears and combined with Kristina Thorson for another 32 strikeouts at 14 and 18 respectively.          As a sophomore, Lawrie earned National Fastpitch Coaches Association First Team All-American and Pac-10 First Team selections. She broke her own strikeouts and strikeout ratio (still tops and career best: 11.5) records; she was ranked and still does in the top-5 for her school season marks in wins, shutouts and innings pitched; the strikeouts and wins were also top-5 for the NCAA year. Lawrie also had a career high in doubles and threw a no-hitter.          In a win over the USF Bulls on February 18, Lawrie struck out a school and career high 20 batters in 7-innings to tie her second in the NCAA for a regulation game total. The Huskies made it to the Women's College World Series and Lawrie responded by tossing her no-hitter over the DePaul Blue Demons on May 31. They were semifinalist before being eliminated by eventually champions the Arizona Wildcats on June 3.          For her junior campaign, Lawrie repeated honors from the NFCA, Pac-10 (Pitcher of The Year) and collected the USA Collegiate Player of The Year and Honda Softball Player of The Year awards. Lawire set schools records for her season wins, strikeouts, WHIP and innings (career highs), leading the NCAA in all except WHIP. Her shutouts, ERA and strikeout ratio were and remain top-10 for a Husky season; they also ranked in the top-10 for the NCAA year and helped Lawrie win a Pac-10 pitching Triple Crown. She also threw two no-hitters.          Beginning on February 7, 2009 with a win over Loyola Marymount Lions, Lawrie achieved a 64.1 consecutive scoreless innings streak. The Portland State Vikings snapped it on March 1 when they scored in the third inning. During the streak, Lawrie won all 11 games (7 complete) and struck out 112, allowing only 15 hits and 11 base on balls. A week later on March 7, Lawrie garnered her 1,000th career strikeout in a win over the Alabama Crimson Tide. After another week, Lawrie combined with Morgan Melloh of the Fresno State Bulldogs for 31 strikeouts in a 11-inning win for the Huskies on March 14.          In the NCAA tournament, Lawrie and the Huskies won a Regional with a 15-inning, 6-1 victory over the Massachusetts Minutewomen on May 18. Lawrie fanned a school and career best 24 batters and with Brandice Balschmiter tossing 14 of her own, combined for the NCAA 4th most combined strikeouts in a single game at 38. Lawrie's total also tied her 4th for an individual pitcher in a single game. At the World Series, Lawrie fought through to the finals, including beginning a career best 21 consecutive game win streak on May 31, defeating the Georgia Bulldogs; the streak would resume and conclude in the 2010 season. Lawrie led the Huskies in back-to-back wins over the No. 1 seeded Florida Gators and in the finale, struck out 8 and drove in the game-winning run to earn MVP and All-Tournament honors.          In her final season, Lawrie earned 2010 First Team from the NFCA and the Pac-10, as well as her second conference Pitcher of The Year. She also picked up her second USA and Honda Player of The Year honors, becoming the first since Cat Osterman with multiple awards for both. Lawrie broke her own record for shutouts (led the NCAA) and ranked and ranks top-5 in season records for the Huskies in wins (also led NCAA), strikeouts, strikeout ratio and innings pitched; these would help earn her another pitching Triple Crown for the Pac-10. She led the team in home runs, RBIs and slugging percentage with career highs, which she also achieved in batting average, hits and walks. She pitched 4 no-hitters, three of them perfect games (an NCAA tying top-5 season record).          To start the year, Lawrie won her first 18 decisions to combine with a last three from 2009 for a 21 consecutive game win streak. The UCLA Bruins broke it on April 1 to open the Pac-10 season. For one of the wins, on February 19, Lawrie won her 100th career game vs. the UCSB Gauchos. On May 15, in a run-rule win over the Arizona State Sun Devils, Lawrie posted career highs in single game hits (3) and RBIs (5). Although the Huskies made it back to defend their National title, they were eventually eliminated by the Arizona Wildcats on June 5.          Lawrie holds the University of Washington crown in career wins, shutouts, strikeouts, strikeout ratio, starts, appearances, complete games and innings. She also ranks top-10 in career home runs. She holds the now-named Pac-12 record for most Player of the Week honors in a career and season and is the all-time conference career strikeouts leader, while ranking top-10 in several other pitching categories. In the NCAA, Lawrie is 4th in career strikeouts, 6th in wins and innings, 8th in strikeout ratio (10.9) and tied 4th in perfect games (4).          Lawrie did not play for the Huskies in their 2008 season because she was representing the Canadian National Team at the 2008 Olympics Games in Beijing, China.          Lawrie was one of 15 players selected to represent Canada in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, where she made three appearances and pitched 12 innings. In her first Olympic appearance, she earned a victory in Canada's 9-2 win over the Netherlands, striking out four in four innings of work, while allowing just one run on two hits. She also hurled a complete game against Venezuela in which she struck out nine batters, allowing just two runs on four hits, but Canada was unable to support her in a 2-0 loss. In all, she struck out 13 batters in 12 innings at Beijing.          Prior to the 2008 Olympic Games, Lawrie was a member of the Canadian National Team in 2005, '06, '07 and '08. She also spent one season on the Canadian Junior National team, and one on the Developmental Team. She helped the National Team qualify for the 2008 Olympics at the 2006 World Cup. In October 2007 at the China Cup, held in Beijing, the Canadians won all three of the games in which Lawrie started, and received the Silver Medal. Lawrie finished the seven-day tournament with a 3-0 record and a team-best 1.29 ERA. Her 21⅔ innings pitched and 18 strikeouts also led the team. She had her best performance of the China Cup against Australia, which had already defeated the Canadians twice in the tournament, pitching seven shutout innings while giving up just two hits and striking out three in leading the team to a 4-0 win. At the 2006 World Cup, Lawrie threw a complete game shutout against Australia with seven strikeouts. She was named Most Valuable Pitcher at the 2006 Canada Cup, where the team was awarded a silver medal. She threw 6⅔ innings of relief against the Netherlands, giving up just one run and striking out 13 batters. She tossed a complete game shutout with five strikeouts against Italy at the 2006 ISF World Championships, where she also earned a shutout victory over Chinese Taipei with eight strikeouts.

Spanning a distance of , the east–west route passes through many small towns and communities in Eastern North Carolina's Inner Banks. It bypasses a large portion of the cities of Greenville and Rocky Mount, and goes through central Tarboro.          The route's eastern terminus is at the same location as North Carolina Highway 304's northern terminus in rural Pamlico County, North Carolina. Both routes terminate in the community of Hobucken on Goose Creek Island, near Mesic.          From the terminus, NC 33 travels west, along with NC 304 southbound across the Intracoastal Waterway (Goose Creek), entering the Goose Creek Game Land. After crossing the bridge, the two state highways split. NC 33 continues in a northwesterly direction across the Gum Swamp out of Pamlico County and into Beaufort County. Veering due west, the route enters the town of Aurora where it joins NC 306 for a three-mile (5 km) concurrency. West of Aurora, the routes split; NC 33 darts northwest again on a route that parallels the Pamlico River. Entering the town of Chocowinity, NC 33 crosses US 17 (which northbound, crosses the Pamlico River into Washington) on its way into Pitt County.          In Pitt County, the route passes through Grimesland before darting west, just passing by the town of Simpson, on its way into Greenville. In the city, the route bears right onto Greenville Boulevard (US 264 Alt), heading north to meet mainline US 264, which bypasses the city to the north. At the junction, NC 33 turns west to head through northern Greenville, sharing a short concurrency with US 13/NC 11/903 before meeting the US 264 freeway (Greenville Bypass) again west of the city.          Continuing northwest out of the Greenville area, NC 33 passes by the eastern terminus of NC 222 and enters Edgecombe County, where the route meets the US 64 south of Princeville. Entering the Princeville area, NC 33 joins US 64A for a short segment, crosses US 258/NC 111/122, and passes over the Tar River into the heart of Tarboro. Heading northeast, the state highway exits Tarboro and meets a junction with NC 97 in Leggett.          Moving into northern Edgecombe County, the route orbits around the city of Rocky Mount, bypassing it, and turning west to meet US 301 in Whitakers after crossing the Nash County line. After a short concurrency with US 301 southbound in the small town, NC 33 heads west for its final stretch, crossing Interstate 95 (exit 150) before ending at North Carolina Highway 4/48. The terminus is located north of Dortches and Rocky Mount, southwest of Enfield, and northeast of Red Oak.          NC 33 was first created in 1929 or 1930 as a spur of parent route NC 30 that ran from Chocowinity to Aurora. It was extended between 1936 and 1938 through Washington as an alternative routing to NC 11. Around 1948-1953, the route's eastern terminus was moved to its current location at Hobucken. Throughout the 1970s, NC 33 was moved in the Washington area and extended through Greenville, taking the place of the old US 264 and NC 30 alignments in the area. In 1994, the final extension occurred during the Tarboro renumbering; the new alignment passed through Tarboro and then picked up the former NC 44's routing through Whitakers to end at NC 4/48.","['Transportation in Nash County, North Carolina', 'Transportation in Edgecombe County, North Carolina', 'Transportation in Pitt County, North Carolina', 'Transportation in Beaufort County, North Carolina', 'Transportation in Pamlico County, North Carolina', 'State highways in North Carolina']"

The caretaking profession includes positions as housesitters, ranch sitters, bed & breakfast and innsitters, property managers, estate managers, and hosts at resorts or campgrounds.          Caretakers are sometimes used by property owners who are unwilling or unable to hire a professional management company. Many homeowners who rent their properties may hire caretakers instead of property managers in order to save money. Caretakers are not licensed by any state or local authority and are often relatively cheaper than their professional counterparts.          In the UK, a number of buildings have a live-in caretaker whose part-time responsibilities might include letting tradesmen in, taking in parcels and signing for letters, holding keys, vacuuming the common areas, washing the communal steps and windows, etc. The caretaker will often live in a flat rent free.          Caretaking is historical, rooted in the British tradition of land maintenance. In 1868, ""The Times"" defined a caretaker as ""a person put in charge of a farm from which the tenant has been evicted."" Today that definition has been expanded to cover a multitude of landowner/caretaker relationships. The number and diversity of these relationships has increased during the past decade. The property caretaking field has been covered by The ""The Caretaker Gazette"" since 1983.",['Property management']

A variant is Mastiha, which is produced on the Greek island of Chios and has a protected designation of origin in the European Union.          The name of the resin, whence the name of the drink, is derived from the Greek ""to chew, to gnash the teeth"".          ""Main article: Mastiha""          In Greece, two different drinks are known under the umbrella term ""mastiha"". ""Mastiha Chiou"" (or ""Chios Mastiha""), is a brandy-based liqueur native to the island of Chios, where mastic has traditionally been cultivated          The other drink is a strong spirit similar to ouzo or tsikoudia. It is served cold or at room temperature but usually with ice. Both turn white (""louche"") when poured over ice or mixed with water, forming small crystals when frozen. They are served with various mezedes — appetizers such as octopus, salad, sardines, calamari, fried zucchini, and clams.          Mastiha often accompanies desserts made with almonds and is served at wedding feasts as a digestif. It has a sweet smell and flavor similar to liquorice.          In Bulgaria mastika is a strong anise-flavoured drink, consumed chilled. Mastika is often combined with menta, a mint liqueur, to make a traditional cocktail called ""cloud"".          According to Bulgarian law, ""Mastika is an alcoholic drink with minimum 47% vol. of alcohol, made of natural ethanol flavoured with anethole, extracted by rectification of essential oils from star anise (Illicium verum), anise (""Pimpinella anissum""), fennel (""Foeniculum vulgare"") or other plant, containing the same aroma component with concentration at least of 2.5 grams per litre, sugar at least 40 grams per litre, with or without addition of mastic and/or aroma destilate and has specific organoleptic characteristics.""          In Macedonia, ""mastika"" is most commonly consumed as an aperitif, usually poured over ice and enjoyed with meze. Containing 43–45% alcohol, it has a hot taste not unlike that of brandy and is usually made from grapes, raisins, plums or figs. In Macedonia, mastika has traditionally been made in the Strumica area; the best known Macedonian brand, ""Strumička mastika"" (""Mastika of Strumica""), made by the company Grozd since 1953, contains 43% alcohol and is produced exclusively at export quality.          In Romania, ""mastícă"" is used as a wedding toast and is thought of as a good accompaniment to traditional chicken dishes.          Turkish raki can sometimes contain mastic.          The production of mastika usually starts with alcoholic base of made from fermented fruit (usually grapes) and double distilled and filtered through the roots of the mastic tree. The alcohol can also be flavoured with the resin of the tree to give the alcoholic drink its distinctive pine-like taste.","['Anise liqueurs and spirits', 'Bulgarian distilled beverages', 'Distilled beverages', 'Macedonian drinks', 'Greek distilled beverages', 'Romanian spirits', 'Greek products with protected designation of origin']"

""Grindelia fraxinipratensis"" is the accepted spelling according to the International Code of Nomenclature.          ""Grindelia fraxinipratensis"" grows in meadows and on the borders of woodlands. It is a biennial or perennial herb growing tall, erect in form, brown or reddish, and hairless and oily. It grows from a thick undergroung caudex atop a woody taproot. The dark green leaves are up to long, widely lance-shaped or oblong, sometimes toothed near the tips, and studded with visible resin glands. The inflorescence bears one to four flower heads lined with thick phyllaries. The head contains about 15 yellow disc florets surrounded by about 13 yellow ray florets each about long. The fruit is an achene with a pappus made up of two awns.          ""Grindelia fraxinipratensis"" is native to the Amargosa Valley along the southern part of the border between California and Nevada, where it is known from only 14 to 16 locations. Many are found within the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in the Amargosa Desert area.          The plant grows in the clay, saline and alkaline soils of the land surrounding desert warm springs in the valley. Its main habitat type is the saltgrass meadow (""Distichlis spicata""). It is relatively abundant in the moist areas of its habitat, and rare in the drier areas.          ""Grindelia fraxinipratensis""is a federally listed threatened species. Habitat in the area was first altered when peat mining was started and Carson Slough, a large local wetland, was drained. The area was then farmed. Large scale farming by corporate agriculture altered much of the Ash Meadows habitat. Today a main threat to the species is the lowering of the water table, which may move water supplies too deep into the soil for the plant to reach with its roots. Other threats include trampling by feral horses and cattle, off-road vehicle use, and non-native plant species.","['Grindelia', 'Flora of California', 'Flora of Nevada', 'Endemic flora of the United States', 'Natural history of the Mojave Desert', 'Natural history of Inyo County, California', 'Plants described in 1972']"

5073426,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5073426,U-Carmen eKhayelitsha,"U-Carmen eKhayelitsha is a 2005 South African operatic film directed and produced by Mark Dornford-May.          The movie is a modern remake of Bizet's 1875 opera ""Carmen"". It was shot entirely in Xhosa, and combines both music from the original opera with traditional African music conducted and directed by the British conductor, Charles Hazlewood. It takes place in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha. ""U-Carmen"" was translated into Xhosa by Andiswa Kedama and Pauline Malefane, who also play Amanda and Carmen in the movie, respectively.          The cast rehearsed for four weeks before they began shooting the film. The film's musical numbers were recorded live on the set without any additional dubbing. The film was Dornford-May's directorial debut. Also, none of the cast members had ever acted on film before.          The film begins when Nomakhaya arrives at a Cape Town police station, looking for police sergeant Jongikhaya. He is out on patrol, so she decides to return later to avoid being harassed by the other officers. Meanwhile, Carmen and Amanda are going to work at the cigarette factory. They pass in front of Jongikhaya's police vehicle and Carmen yells at him for parking there. Nomakhaya eventually finds Jongikhaya and gives him a ring that his dying mother sent him: she urges him to return to his village to see his mother before she dies. A flashback reveals that Jongikhaya has been disowned by his mother after he drowned his brother during an argument. Later, the bored police officers decide to go to the cigarette factory to see the girls. Carmen is piqued when Jongikhaya reads his Bible and ignores her. She flirts with him and throws a rose into his car.           Later, the cigarette girls are watching TV when they see that a singing star, Lulamile Nkomo, from their township is returning to the area for a special concert. Pinki turns off the TV when Carmen is trying to watch the footage and a fight ensues. The police arrive to break up the fight; Jongikhaya takes Carmen into custody after she wounds Pinki with a knife. However, Carmen convinces Jongikhaya to let her go in exchange for her love and promises to meet him later at a local bar. Jongikhaya is demoted by Captain Gantana and confined to barracks for his role in the escape.          Several days later, Carmen, Amanda, the cigarette factory workers, and Carmen's drug dealer friends eagerly await the arrival of Lulamile Nkomo at Bra Nkomo's bar. The police arrive to search for Carmen, but she hides. Jongikhaya also arrives, although he is treated with hostility by the factory girls and the drug traffickers until Carmen vouches for him. He declares his undying love for Carmen and she warns him again that she only belongs to herself. He also gives her his mother's ring. At the urging of Carmen, Jongikhaya quits his job and becomes a drug trafficker. However, one night during a smuggling operation, he becomes jealous when Carmen is friendly towards another man and starts a fight. The other drug traffickers beat him up and a furious Carmen declares that their relationship is over. Carmen returns the ring that he gave her. Jongikhaya is determined that Carmen will not forget him. He declares he will kill her if she rejects him.          Carmen is scheduled to sing at Lulamile Nkomo's homecoming concert. Her friends warn her that Jongikhaya is in the audience. When Carmen tries to tell Jongikhaya that their relationship is over, he chases her outside the music venue and threatens her with a knife. Despite his ominous threat, Carmen refuses to take him back. Jongikhaya stabs her and is seized by members of the concert audience as she dies.          The film won critical acclaim when it received the Golden Bear at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival.

2927689,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2927689,Advance ship notice,"An advanced ship notice or advanced shipping notice (ASN) is a notification of pending deliveries, similar to a packing list. It is usually sent in an electronic format and is a common EDI document. In the EDI X12 system, it is known as the EDI 856 document and the EDIFACT equivalent is the DESADV (Dispatch Advice) message. The ASN can be used to list the contents of a shipment of goods as well as additional information relating to the shipment, such as order information, product description, physical characteristics, type of packaging, markings, carrier information, and configuration of goods within the transportation equipment. The ASN enables the sender to describe the contents and configuration of a shipment in various levels of detail and provides an ordered flexibility to convey information.          The ASN is noteworthy in that it is a new concept in logistics, enabled by the advance of modern communication methods. Although it provides information similar to the Bill of lading, its function is very different. While the Bill of lading is meant to accompany a load on its path, the goal of the ASN is to provide information to the destination's receiving operations well in advance of delivery. This tends to impact the logistics stream in three areas: cost, accuracy, and flexibility.           Cost. Modern receiving operations rarely have time to break down a shipping unit (carton or pallet) and identify its components, depending instead on quick scans of barcodes on shipping labels. An ASN can provide a list of all of the barcoded ID numbers of the shipping units and the contents of each. Receiving costs are thought to be reduced by about 40%.           Accuracy. Upon receipt of the ASN, the receiver is immediately informed of any difference between what was expected, and what has actually been shipped.          Flexibility. Knowing the actual fill rates of the orders gives the receiver the opportunity to re-allocate goods in subsequent shipments.          ASN and finance           The ASN can be used to pay suppliers directly for goods received. This can be accomplished by receiving the ASN into the company computer system (ERP), printing company labels for each container received, affixing the labels on the containers, and then transmitting any discrepancies to the supplier via EDI.",['E-commerce']

6696464,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6696464,South Carolina in the American Civil War,"South Carolina was a site of a major political and military importance for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The white population of the state strongly supported the institution of slavery long before the war, since the 18th century. Political leaders such as Democrats John Calhoun and Preston Brooks had inflamed regional and national passions in support of the institution, and for years before the eventual start of the Civil War in 1861, pro-slavery voices cried for secession.          The Civil War began in South Carolina. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina, having the highest percentage of slaves of any U.S. state at 57% of its population enslaved and 46% of its families owning at least one slave, became the first state to declare that it had seceded from the Union. The first shots of the Civil War (January 9, 1861) were fired in Charleston by its Citadel cadets upon a U.S. civilian merchant ship, ""Star of the West"", bringing supplies to the beleaguered U.S. garrison at Fort Sumter. The April 1861 bombardment of Fort Sumter by South Carolinian forces under the command of General Beauregard—the Confederacy did not yet have a functioning army—is commonly regarded as the beginning of the war.          South Carolina was a source of troops for the Confederate army, and as the war progressed, also for the Union, as thousands of ex-slaves flocked to join the Union forces. The state also provided uniforms, textiles, food, and war material, as well as trained soldiers and leaders from The Citadel and other military schools. In contrast to most other Confederate states, South Carolina had a well-developed rail network linking all of its major cities without a break of gauge. Relatively free from Union occupation until the very end of the war, South Carolina hosted a number of prisoner of war camps. South Carolina also was the only Confederate state not to harbor pockets of anti-secessionist fervor strong enough to send large amounts of white men to fight for the Union, as every other state in the Confederacy did.          Among the leading generals from the Palmetto State were Wade Hampton III, one of the Confederacy's leading cavalrymen, Maxcy Gregg, killed in action at Fredericksburg, Joseph B. Kershaw, whose South Carolina infantry brigade saw some of the hardest fighting of the Army of Northern Virginia and James Longstreet who served in that army under Robert E. Lee and in the Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg.          For decades, South Carolinian political leaders had promoted regional passions with threats of nullification and secession in the name of southern states rights and protection of the interests of the slave power.          Alfred P. Aldrich, a South Carolinian politician from Barnwell, stated that declaring secession would be necessary if a Republican candidate were to win the 1860 U.S. presidential election, stating that it was the only way for the state to preserve slavery and diminish the influence of the anti-slavery Republican Party, which, were its goals of abolition realized, would result in the ""destruction of the South"":          In a January 1860 speech, South Carolinian congressman Laurence Massillon Keitt, summed up this view in an oratory condemning the Republican Party for its anti-slavery views, claiming that slavery was not morally wrong, but rather, justified:          Later that year, in December, Keitt would state that South Carolina's declaring of secession was the direct result of slavery:          On November 9, 1860 the South Carolina General Assembly passed a ""Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President a Hostile Act"" and stated its intention to declare secession from the United States.          In December 1860, amid the secession crisis, former South Carolinian congressman John McQueen wrote to a group of civic leaders in Richmond, Virginia, regarding the reasons as to why South Carolina was contemplating secession from the Union. In the letter, McQueen claimed that U.S. president-elect Abraham Lincoln supported equality and civil rights for African Americans as well as the abolition of slavery, and thus South Carolina, being opposed to such measures, was compelled to secede:          South Carolinian religious leader James Henley Thornwell also espoused a similar view to McQueen's, stating that slavery was justified under the Christian religion, and thus, those who viewed slavery as being immoral were opposed to Christianity:          Other religious institutions in South Carolina also expressed support for slavery. The Southern Presbyterian of S.C. declared that:          On November 10, 1860 the S.C. General Assembly called for a ""Convention of the People of South Carolina"" to consider secession. Delegates were to be elected on December 6. The secession convention convened in Columbia on December 17 and voted unanimously, 169-0, to declare secession from the United States. The convention then adjourned to Charleston to draft an ordinance of secession. When the ordinance was adopted on December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the first slave state in the south to declare that it had seceded from the United States. James Buchanan, the United States president, declared the ordinance illegal but did not act to stop it.          A committee of the convention also drafted a ""Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina"" which was adopted on December 24. The secession declaration stated the primary reasoning behind South Carolina's declaring of secession from the Union, which was described as:          The declaration also claims that secession was declared as a result of the refusal of free states to enforce the Fugitive Slave Acts. Although the declaration does argue that secession is justified on the grounds of U.S. ""encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States,"" the grievances that the declaration goes on to list are mainly concerned with the property of rights of slave holders. Broadly speaking, the declaration argues that the U.S. Constitution was framed to establish each State ""as an equal"" in the Union, with ""separate control over its own institutions"", such as ""the right of property in slaves.""          A repeated concern is runaway slaves. The declaration argues that parts of the U.S. Constitution were specifically written to ensure the return of slaves who had escaped to other states, and quotes the 4th Article: ""No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."" The declaration goes on to state that this stipulation of the Constitution was so important to the original signers, ""that without it that compact [the Constitution] would not have been made."" Laws from the ""General Government"" upheld this stipulation ""for many years,"" the declaration says, but ""an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the Institution of Slavery has led to a disregard of their obligations."" Because the constitutional agreement had been ""deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States,"" the consequence was that ""South Carolina is released from her obligation"" to be part of the Union.          A further concern was Lincoln's recent election to the presidency, whom they claimed desired to see slavery on ""the course of ultimate extinction"":          The South Carolinian secession declaration of December 1860 also channeled some elements from the U.S. Declaration of Independence from July 1776. However, the South Carolinian version omitted the phrases that ""all men are created equal"", ""that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights"", and mentions of the ""consent of the governed"". Professor and historian Harry V. Jaffa noted these omissions as significant in his 2000 book, ""A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War"":          Jaffa states that South Carolina omitted references to human equality and consent of the governed, as due to their racist and pro-slavery views, secessionist South Carolinians did not believe in those ideals:          On December 25, the day following South Carolina's declaration of secession, a South Carolinian convention delivered an ""Address to the Slaveholding States"":          ""Slavery, not states' rights, birthed the Civil War,"" argues sociologist James W. Loewen. Writing of South Carolina's Declaration of Secession, Loewen writes that          The state adopted the palmetto flag as its banner, a slightly modified version of which is used as its current state flag. South Carolina after secession was frequently called the ""Palmetto Republic"".          After South Carolina declared its secession, former congressman James L. Petigru famously remarked, ""South Carolina is too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum."" Soon afterwards, South Carolina began preparing for a presumed U.S. military response while working to convince other southern states to secede as well and join in a confederacy of southern states.          On February 4, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama, a convention consisting of delegates from South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana met to form a new constitution and government modeled on that of the United States. On February 8, 1861, South Carolina officially joined the Confederacy. According to one South Carolinian newspaper editor:          South Carolina's declaring of secession was supported by the state's religious figures, who claimed that it was consistent with the tenets of their religion:          Six days after secession, on the day after Christmas, Major Robert Anderson, commander of the U.S. troops in Charleston, withdrew his men to the island fortress of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. South Carolina militia swarmed over the abandoned mainland batteries and trained their guns on the island. Sumter was the key position for preventing a naval attack upon Charleston, so secessionists were determined not to allow U.S. forces to remain there indefinitely. More importantly, South Carolina's claim of independence would look empty if U.S. forces controlled its largest harbor. On January 9, 1861, the U.S. ship ""Star of the West"" approached to resupply the fort. Cadets from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina fired upon the Star of the West, striking the ship three times and causing it to retreat back to New York.          Mississippi declared its secession several weeks after South Carolina, and five other states of the lower South soon followed. Both the outgoing Buchanan administration and President-elect Lincoln denied that any state had a right to secede. On February 4, a congress of the seven seceding states met in Montgomery, Alabama, and approved a new constitution for the Confederate States of America. South Carolina entered the Confederacy on February 8, 1861, fewer than six weeks after declaring itself the independent State of South Carolina.          Upper Southern slave states such as Virginia and North Carolina, which had initially voted against secession, called a peace conference, to little effect.          Meanwhile, Virginian orator Roger Pryor barreled into Charleston and proclaimed that the only way to get his state to join the Confederacy was for South Carolina to instigate war with the United States. The obvious place to start was right in the midst of Charleston Harbor.          On April 10, the ""Mercury"" reprinted stories from New York papers that told of a naval expedition that had been sent southward toward Charleston. Lincoln advised the governor of South Carolina that the ships were sent to resupply the fort, not to reinforce it. The Carolinians could no longer wait if they hoped to take the fort before the U.S. Navy arrived. About 6,000 men were stationed around the rim of the harbor, ready to take on the 60 men in Fort Sumter. At 4:30 a.m. on April 12, after two days of intense negotiations, and with Union ships approaching the harbor, the firing began. Students from The Citadel were among those firing the first shots of the war, though Edmund Ruffin is usually credited with firing the first shot. Thirty-four hours later, Anderson's men raised the white flag and were allowed to leave the fort with colors flying and drums beating, saluting the U.S. flag with a 50-gun salute before taking it down. During this salute, one of the guns exploded, killing a young soldier—the only casualty of the bombardment and the first casualty of the war.          In December 1861, South Carolina received $100,000 from Georgia after a disastrous fire in Charleston.          Fort Wagner was the scene of two battles.          The First Battle of Fort Wagner, occurred on July 11, 1863. Only 12 Confederate soldiers were killed, as opposed to the Union's 339 losses.          The Second Battle of Fort Wagner, a week later, is better known. This was the Union attack on July 18, 1863, led by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first major American military units made up of black soldiers. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw led the 54th Massachusetts on foot while they charged, and was killed in the assault.          Although a tactical defeat, the publicity of the battle of Fort Wagner led to further action for black troops in the Civil War, and it spurred additional recruitment that gave the Union Army a further numerical advantage in troops over the South.          The Union besieged the fort after the unsuccessful assault. By August 25, Union entrenchments were close enough to attempt an assault on the Advanced Rifle Pits, 240 yards in front of the Battery, but this attempt was defeated. A second attempt, by the 24th Mass. Inf., on August 26 was successful. After enduring almost 60 days of heavy shelling, the Confederates abandoned it on the night of September 6–7, 1863. withdrawing all operable cannons and the garrison.          The Confederacy was at a disadvantage in number, weaponry, and supplies. Union ships sailed south and blocked off one port after another. As early as November, Union troops occupied the Sea Islands in the Beaufort area, establishing an important base for the men and ships who would obstruct the ports at Charleston and Savannah. When the plantation owners, many of which had already gone off with the Confederate army elsewhere, fled the area, the Sea Island slaves became the first ""freedmen"" of the war, and the Sea Islands became the laboratory for Union plans to educate the African Americans for their eventual role as full American citizens Despite South Carolina's important role in the start of the war, and a long unsuccessful attempt to take Charleston from 1863 onward, few military engagements occurred within the state's borders until 1865, when Sherman's Army, having already completed its March to the Sea in Savannah, marched to Columbia and leveled most of the town, as well as a number of towns along the way and afterward. South Carolina lost 12,922 men to the war, 23% of its male white population of fighting age, and the highest percentage of any state in the nation. Sherman's 1865 march through the Carolinas resulted in the burning of Columbia and numerous other towns. The destruction his troops wrought upon South Carolina was even worse than in Georgia, because many of his men bore a particular grudge against the state and its citizens, who they blamed for starting the war. One of Sherman's men declared, ""Here is where treason began and, by God, here is where it shall end!"" Poverty would mark the state for generations to come.          In January 1865, the Charleston ""Courier"" newspaper condemned suggestions that the Confederacy abandon slavery were it to help in gaining independence, stating that such suggestions were ""folly"":          On February 21, 1865, with the Confederate forces finally evacuated from Charleston, the black 54th Massachusetts Regiment marched through the city. At a ceremony at which the U.S. flag was once again raised over Fort Sumter, former fort commander Robert Anderson was joined on the platform by two men: African American Union hero Robert Smalls and the son of Denmark Vesey.",['South Carolina in the American Civil War']
26374841,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26374841,Portrait of Frédéric Chopin and George Sand,"The Portrait of Frédéric Chopin and George Sand was an 1838 unfinished oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Eugène Delacroix. Originally a double portrait, it was later cut in two and sold off as separate pieces. It showed composer Frédéric Chopin (1810–49) playing piano while writer George Sand (1804–76) sits to his right, listening and smoking a cigar (a favorite activity of hers). The sitters were lovers at the time, and both were close friends of the artist.           The portrait remained in Delacroix's studio until his death. Shortly afterward, it was cut into two separate works, both of which are tightly focused. Chopin's portrait comprises only a head shot, while Sand's shows her upper body but is narrowly cut. This led to the loss of large areas of the original canvas. The reason for the divide is likely the then-owner's belief that two paintings would sell for a higher price than one. Today Chopin's portrait is housed at the Louvre in Paris, while Sand's hangs at Copenhagen's Ordrupgaard Museum.          George Sand was a French Romantic novelist, one of the first female French writers to establish an international reputation. She become known for behavior unusual for a woman at the time, including openly conducting affairs, smoking a pipe and wearing men's clothing. Sand had been a friend of Delacroix for a number of years, though the painter did not hold her work in high regard. She met Chopin in 1836 and from 1838 conducted a relationship with him for ten years, until two years before he died. Much of the composer's best work was done during those ten years. Though their relationship began as physical, Chopin's failing health (described in Sand's autobiographical ""Winter in           Mallorca"") in time changed her role to that of caregiver.           Sand introduced Delacroix to Chopin in 1838, and the two men remained close friends until the composer's death.          The double portrait showed Chopin playing piano while Sand sat and listened. Little is known of the painting's origin or the circumstances of its execution. It is not known whether it was a commission or intended as a gift to the composer. It is known that Delacroix borrowed a piano so that the work could be painted in his studio. The double portrait was not finished, and ironically one of the elements that was not painted was the piano.          The Sand canvas is generally seen as the more interesting because, in its original form, it was intended as a counterpoint to the Chopin portrait, not as a stand-alone work. As such, it contravenes many conventions of portraiture. It was usual in 19th-century bust-sized paintings for the subject to be largely static, but here Sand is shown reacting to the music Chopin is playing, and highly animated and energetic in her emotional response.

Born in Peshawar, Anand studied at Khalsa College, Amritsar, graduating with honours in 1924, before moving to England, where he attended University College London as an undergraduate and later Cambridge University, earning a PhD in Philosophy in 1929. During this time he forged friendships with members of the Bloomsbury Group. He spent some time in Geneva, lecturing at the League of Nations' School of Intellectual Cooperation.          Anand's literary career was launched by family tragedy, instigated by the rigidity of the caste system. His first prose essay was a response to the suicide of an aunt, who had been excommunicated by her family for sharing a meal with a Muslim woman. His first main novel, ""Untouchable"", published in 1935, was a chilling expose of the day-to-day life of a member of India's untouchable caste. It is the story of a single day in the life of Bakha, a toilet-cleaner, who accidentally bumps into a member of a higher caste.          Bakha searches for salve to the tragedy of the destiny into which he was born, talking with a Christian missionary, listening to a speech about untouchability by Mahatma Gandhi and a subsequent conversation by two educated Indians, but by the end of the book Anand suggests that it is technology, in the form of the newly introduced flush toilet that may be his savior by eliminating the need for a caste of toilet cleaners.          This simple book, which captured the puissance of the Punjabi and Hindi idiom in English was widely acclaimed and Anand won the reputation of being India's Charles Dickens. The introduction was written by his friend, E. M. Forster, whom he met while working on T. S. Eliot's magazine ""Criterion"". Forster writes: ""Avoiding rhetoric and circumlocution, it has gone straight to the heart of its subject and purified it.""          Inevitably, Anand, who in the 1930s and '40s spent half his time in London and half in India, was drawn to the Indian independence movement. During his time in London, he wrote propaganda on behalf of the Indian cause alongside India's future Defence Minister V. K. Krishna Menon, while trying to make a living as a novelist and journalist. At the same time, he also supported freedom elsewhere around the globe and even travelled to Spain to volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, even though his role in the conflict was more journalistic than military. He spent World War II working as a scriptwriter for the BBC in London, where he became a friend of George Orwell. Orwell penned a favourable review of Anand's 1942 novel ""The Sword and the Sickle"" and remarked that ""although Mr. Anand's novel would still be interesting on its own merits if it had been written by an Englishman, it is impossible to read it without remembering every few pages that is also a cultural curiosity,"" adding that the growth ""of an English-language Indian literature is a strange phenomenon"". He was also a friend of Picasso and had Picasso paintings in his collection.          Anand returned to India in 1946, and continued with his prodigious literary output there. His work includes poetry and essays on a wide range of subjects, as well as autobiographies, novels and short stories. Prominent among his novels are ""The Village"" (1939), ""Across the Black Waters"" (1939), ""The Sword and the Sickle"" (1942), all written in England, and ""Coolie"" (1936), ""The Private Life of an Indian Prince"" (1953), perhaps the most important of his works written in India. He also founded a literary magazine, ""Marg"", and taught in various universities. During the 1970s, he worked with the International Progress Organization (IPO) on the issue of cultural self-comprehension of nations. His contribution to the conference of the IPO in Innsbruck (Austria) in 1974 had a special influence on debates that later became known under the phrase of ""Dialogue Among Civilizations"". Anand also delivered a series of lectures on eminent Indians including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath Tagore, commemorating their achievements and significance and paying special attention to their distinct brands of humanism.          His 1953 novel ""The Private Life of an Indian Prince"" was more autobiographical in nature. In 1950 Anand embarked on a project to write a seven-part autobiography, beginning in 1951 with ""Seven Summers"". One part, ""Morning Face"" (1968), won him the Sahitya Akademi Award. Like much of his later work, it contains elements of his spiritual journey as he struggles to attain a higher sense of self-awareness.          He died of pneumonia in Pune on 28 September 2004 at the age of 98.          Anand, who was associated with Communism, used his novels to make broad attacks on various elements of India's social structure and on British rule in India; they are considered important for their social statement.","['1905 births', '2004 deaths', 'Alumni of the University of Cambridge', 'Alumni of University College London', 'Indian socialists', 'Indian male novelists', 'English-language writers from India', 'People of the Spanish Civil War', 'Recipients of the Sahitya Akademi Award in English', 'Recipients of the Padma Bhushan', 'People from Peshawar', 'Indian magazine editors', 'Fellows of the Lalit Kala Akademi', '20th-century novelists']"

19349000,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19349000,Zig and Zag (puppets),"Zig and Zag are an Irish puppet duo performed by Mick O'Hara and Ciaran Morrison.          The characters are a pair of furry extraterrestrial twins from the planet Zog. They made their television début in 1987 on RTÉ's ""Dempsey's Den"". A year later they won a Jacob's Award for TV Personalities of the year. In 1992 Zig and Zag found fame in the UK when they joined the team of the Channel 4 breakfast show ""The Big Breakfast"". During the 1990s the characters spawned a merchandising range of comic books, videos and embarked on a recording career – scoring a UK number one single with ""Them Girls Them Girls"".          In 2010 the characters saw a resurgence in their popularity as they joined the ""Big Brother's Little Brother"" team and in October 2010 they were commissioned to host a flagship Saturday morning radio show on 2FM called ""Smells Like Saturday"". A brand new TV bloopers show hosted by Zig and Zag entitled ""Zig & Zag's Superbloopers"" was announced on the RTÉ TV website. In April 2015, it was announced that the duo would return in 2016 with a 26 episode animated series commissioned by RTÉ and the BBC.          Zig and Zag's full names are Zigmund Ambrose Zogly and Zagnatius Hillary Zogly and claim they were born 29 February 1971 on Zog.          Zig is beige (although he claimed to be fawn) with red ""zogabongs"" (pom-pom antennae) and a tuft of green hair, and Zag is purple with green spots and yellow zogabongs and dreadlocks.          In their original RTÉ incarnation, Zig often came across as the more intelligent one, with Zag under his thumb (most evident in their ""Story Time"" segments, when Zig would read a nursery rhyme to the audience, and Zag would grudgingly act it out). Zag also displayed a penchant for cross-dressing and playing with Barbie dolls.          However, after the two moved to Channel 4, Zag began to be portrayed as the more intelligent older brother, a lecherous lady-killer who claimed to fly every weekend to Hollywood to dine with the stars, as well as performing ragga songs in his guise of ""Ragga Zagga"".          Zig was then portrayed as a weak-willed childish simpleton, constantly giggling at rude jokes (like the word ""bottom""), obsessed with specific things (such as ""The Hunt for Red October"" or his rash) and frequently unaware of what was going on around him.          Zig and Zag frequently appeared dressed as other characters, in particular during their tenure on The Den. Such characters ranged from would-be distant relatives to superheroes.          Captain Joke - Zag's primary superhero identity, Captain Joke had no superpowers other than his ability to tell silly jokes. He wore a red mask on his eyes and matching cape and only Zig suspected his identity.          Captain Pillowcase - While Captain Joke's true identity was never discovered, Zig's first attempt at being a superhero was far less successful and was generally met with contempt. The character consisted of Zig wearing a pillowcase over his head. Captain Pillowcase's alleged special ability consisted of using his pillowcase to do impressions, such as his impression of Mount Everest or an ice cream cone melting.          Captain Shamrock - Zig's next superhero alter ego was far more successful. Captain Shamrock generally only made appearances on Saint Patrick's Day. He spoke with a strong American accent and, as such, was delivered as a satire on American tourists visiting Ireland to discover their roots. Captain Shamrock managed to convince the others that he was the primary authority on all things Irish, and would often tell nonsensical stories loosely based on Irish folklore.          Cousin Nigel - Zig and Zag's obnoxious, brattish cousin who would constantly complain about everything in a strong Birmingham accent. Cousin Nigel consisted of Zig wearing a pair of drinking glasses over his eyes and a cub scouts hat.          Sunny Daze - Another Zig alter ego, Sunny Daze was the star crooner at the Rotten Apple Club.          Ciaran Morrison and Mick O'Hara provide the voices for Zig and for Zag, respectively. Their production company, Double Z Enterprises produced ""The Den"" when Zig and Zag featured. In 2003 they produced a TV series for Channel 4, The Bronx Bunny Show. They also regularly appear on RTÉ Two in their current incarnations of Podge and Rodge, fellow characters from ""The Den"" with an unsavoury past but who are now reformed enough for RTÉ to commission their own primetime chat show, ""The Podge and Rodge Show"".          When Ian Dempsey left the then titled ""Dempsey's Den"" in 1990, Zig and Zag remained on with his replacement Ray D'Arcy. Their alien dog, Zuppy, also featured on television at this time. Zuppy remained with ""The Den"" for some years after Zig and Zag left.          After having worked on ""The Den"" for a number of years, Zig and Zag worked concurrently on ""The Big Breakfast"", subsequently exiting ""The Den"" to work on the show exclusively. After their departure from RTÉ, Dustin the Turkey took over with new character Soky.          On ""The Big Breakfast"", the two acted as interviewers in the ""crunch"" segment of the show. Among the memorable results was them teaching Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man and Ol' Dirty Bastard ""how to fold a serviette like a pineapple"". ""I did like them guys,"" recalled ODB. ""Anything to do with aliens is fine with Dirty.""          During this time, they also starred in a series of adverts for Yoplait yogurts. Zig and Zag made an appearance on MTV Europe's ""MTV's Most Wanted"", leading to their own MTV Europe sketch programme, ""The Zig and Zag Show"". After a revamp of ""The Big Breakfast"", they were dropped and produced a kids entertainment show, also entitled ""The Zig and Zag Show"", for ITV. They then returned to Ireland to present the music quiz, ""2Phat"" with Ray D'Arcy until 2001. They starred in a children's programme called ""Me:Tv"" for Nickelodeon UK and Ireland in the summer of 2006, the premise of which was kids used their own webcams to present the show. In 2010 they joined Big Brother's Little Brother team to interview past contestants.          Zig and Zag returned to Irish TV screens with an hour-long Christmas special in 2011 entitled ""Zig and Zag's Superbloopers"" co-hosted by Aidan Power. The three returned for a six-part series of the blooper show broadcast on RTÉ 1 in September 2012. A second Christmas special this time entitled ""Superfestivebloopers"" was produced and broadcast on Christmas Day 2013.          In May 2012, Double Z Productions and Flickerpix announced they were gearing up to begin production over the summer for a new, 2D animated show to debut in 2015. The series is written by Zig and Zag creators Ciaran Morrison and Mick O’Hara who will also voice the characters. The series will be produced by Ronan McCabe for Double Z and David Cumming for Flickerpix. Joel Simon, creative director at Flickerpix, will direct the series. The first animated series (26 x 11mins) simply entitled ""Zig and Zag"" was broadcast on CBBC and RTÉ in Spring 2016.          Zig and Zag made a surprise guest appearance on TFI Friday on 18 December 2015 in what could be the last ever live episode of the show. They had previously appeared on the show during its first season in 1996. They joined Chris Evans for the Christmas Special and when Gaby Roslin appeared later in the show she stated that it was the first time all four former Big Breakfast presenters had been together on screen in 21 years.          Zig and Zag's first single ""The Christmas No.1"" reached No.1 in Ireland at Christmas 1990 and stayed there for five weeks. Their album ""Never Mind the Zogabongs...Here's Zig and Zag"" and second single ""Zig Zaggin Around"" both also topped the Irish charts in 1991. On the back of their success on the Big Breakfast the pair were signed by Simon Cowell and released two singles on RCA. ""Them Girls, Them Girls"" produced by DJ Erick Morillo was released throughout Europe and its highest chart position in the U.K charts was at No.5 for the week ending 7 January 1995.          Zig and Zag produced a number of books in Ireland and the U.K. The first five books in the list were produced exclusively in Ireland as paperback fully illustrated comic books. In the U.K a further two comic book style paperbacks were produced, a hardback annual, a tie-in book with their TV series Dirty Deeds, with photographs and text related to the series and a 416-page joke book.

35285319,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35285319,Doña Rosa,"Doña Rosa, full name Rosa Real Mateo de Nieto, was a Mexican ceramics artisan from San Bartolo Coyotepec, Oaxaca, Mexico. She is noted for inventing a technique to make the local pottery type, barro negro, black and shiny after firing. This created new markets for the ceramics with collectors and tourists.           The origins of barro negro pottery extend over centuries, with examples of it found at a number of Mexican archeological sites, fashioned mostly into jars and other utilitarian items. It has remained a traditional crafts of the Zapotecs and Mixtecs of the Central Valleys area to the present day. Originally all barro negro pottery was matte and grayish due to the qualities of the clay and the firing process. In this form, the pottery is very sturdy, allowing it to be hit without breaking. The barro negro pottery of Doña Rosa’s hometown of San Bartolo has been traditionally used to make large “cántaros”, tall vessels used for storing and transporting liquids, including mezcal.          In the 1950s, Doña Rosa discovered that she could change the color and shine of the pieces by making some changes to how the clay piece is handled. Just before the formed clay piece is completely dry, it is polished with a quartz stone to compress the surface. It is then fired at a slightly lower temperature than traditional pieces. After firing, the piece emerges a shiny black instead of a dull gray. This innovation makes the pieces more breakable, but it has made the pottery far more popular with Mexican folk art collectors, which included Nelson Rockefeller, who promoted it in the United States. The popularity stems from the look, rather than durability, so many pieces such as containers, whistles, flutes, bells, masks, lamps and animal figures are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utilitarian.           Doña Rosa died in 1980, but the tradition of making the ""barro negro pottery"" is being carried on by Doña Rosa’s daughter and grandchildren who stage demonstrations for tourists. The workshop is still in the family home, where shelves and shelves of shiny black pieces for sale line the inner courtyard. Despite being the origin of black polished clay, the pieces at the Doña Rosa Workshop are less expensive than in other parts of Mexico.","['Mexican potters', '1980 deaths', 'Year of birth missing']"

The Mission is to ""promote the well-being of the underserved by providing access to high quality healthcare for all regardless of ability to pay.""          UMMA was started by a small group of UCLA students in 1991. Their goal: to set up a free clinic for the benefit of an entire community, based on the premise that healthcare is a right and not a privilege. The student founders approached and won the support of the City of Los Angeles; University of California, Los Angeles, and Charles R. Drew University.          They worked with government officials to raise $1.3 million in grants, brainstormed with architects to rebuild a dilapidated structure on Florence Ave. in South Los Angeles, and collected donated equipment.          In September 1996, UMMA Clinic's doors to the community were opened. The students have since themselves become doctors, researchers and parents.          Over a ten-year period, UMMA's infrastructure has grown considerably; today employing 18 full-time staff, supported by a legion of volunteers.

22597767,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22597767,Niní Marshall,"Marina Esther Traveso (June 1, 1903 – March 18, 1996), known by her stage name Niní Marshall, was an Argentine humorist, comic actress and screenwriter; nicknamed ""The Chaplin with a skirt"" and ""The Lady of Humour"".          She was born in Buenos Aires to Pedro and María Ángela Traveso, a well-to-do family in Rosario, in 1903. Losing her father at two months of age, she was raised by her mother, who affectionately called her ""Niní."" They relocated to the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Caballito when Niní was in her teens, and she began a career in advertising. She met Felipe Edelman, an engineer, while in her senior year in secondary school, and they married in 1922, a few months after the birth of their only daughter, Ángeles. The happy occasion was followed by her mother's untimely death, however, a tragedy compounded by Felipe Edelman's decline into compulsive gambling. Facing economic ruin, the couple were separated shortly afterwards and she remarried.          Traverso drew on her advertising experience and wit to secure work in ""La Novela Semanal"", a well-known women's leisure magazine, in 1933. She also contributed to the radio variety show, ""Sintonía"", as an entertainment critic and publicist until 1934 and appeared in numerous other radio programs. A multi-lingual and prolific writer, she began signing her varied articles as ""Mitzi."" Traveso debuted as a singer on Radio Municipal in 1936, and met her second husband, Marcelo Salcedo, at that time. She soon began appearing in Buenos Aires' vibrant theatre, where she developed two satirical characters, ""Cándida"" y ""Catita""; by then, she had adopted another pseudonym: ""Niní Marshall.""           These roles led to a prestigious ""Sensación Radiofónica"" award in 1937 for her work in ""Sintonía"" and to a film deal with Enrique Susini's Lumiton Studios in 1938. Portraying her character ""Catita"" (an Italian Argentine cook), opposite Mecha Ortiz and Tito Lusiardo (Catita's fastidious employers), in ""Mujeres que trabajan"" (""Working Women""), the comedy's success led to an offer the following year to portray Catita's par, ""Cándida"" (an antiquated Galician maid), for which she also wrote the screenplay.          Her thickly-accented characters and use of ethnic humor were not without their detractors, however. The conservative government in power in Argentina at the time ordered her banned from the radio in 1940 and, in 1943, newly installed dictator Gen. Pedro Ramírez had her banned from the cinema, on the charge of ""deforming the language,"" leading to her exile in Mexico. A leading box office draw, she portrayed either Catita or Cándida in numerous more films, as well starring in other notable comedy roles such as Conrado Nalé Roxlo's adaptation of Victorien Sardou's ""Madame Sans Gêne"", in 1945.          Following President Juan Perón's 1955 overthrow, Marshall returned to Argentina and to her comedy stanby for her first post-exile role in Julio Saraceni's ""Catita es una dama"" (""Catita is a Lady"", 1956). Continuing to perform in the radio and theatre, she went on to create numerous other comedy characters, among them: Cosme, Doña Caterina, Doña Pola, Mingo, the aristocratic Mónica de Picos Pardo Unzué Crostón, Niña Jovita, Pedantina, Sabelotodo and Ursilina (all satires of stereotypically Argentine types, and some male). Her work in the theatre helped make household names of young colleagues of hers such as Zully Moreno, Enrique Pinti, Antonio Gasalla and Juan Carlos Altavista, as well making successes of theatre pieces such as ""Coqueluche"" (with Thelma Biral) and a 1972 monologue, ""Y se nos fue redepente"" (""Left Suddenly"").          Her last film role starred opposite veteran comic Luis Sandrini in ""¡Qué linda es mi familia!"" (""My Family's Beautiful!""). The 1980 yarn on a quiet, elderly couple's brush with fame would be the ailing Sandrini's last, as well. She earned a Konex Award in 1981, and retired from show business the following year. She penned her memoirs in 1985 and reemerged in the theatre briefly for a friend, dramatist Antonio Gasalla, in 1988. The acclaimed role earned her a recognition as an Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires in 1989. Given the award not by the mayor, but by newly elected President Carlos Menem, he apologized to her for the persecution she endured 40 years earlier. Argentine cinema standards Norma Aleandro and Alfredo Alcón presented her with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992 and theatre revivals of her work were produced from 1992 to 1995 locally and in Paris, including two works written in her honor.

38681581,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38681581,List of Power Rangers Mystic Force characters,"""Power Rangers Mystic Force"" is the 2006 season of Power Rangers which tells the story of the fight between the Mystic Rangers and the evil Forces of Darkness who are trying to rule over the worlds of mortals and magic.          The powers of the Mystic Rangers are derived from beings known as the Ancient Titans, creatures with great elemental powers, symbolized by mythological creatures from various Earth mythologies on the Ranger's visors (the creatures being the phoenix, the sprite, the garuda, the minotaur and the mermaid). To date, they are the only team of rangers to not have some kind of team-up special with another ranger team in their own season.          Nicholas ""Nick"" Russell is the Red Mystic Ranger. He is also Madison Rocca's love interest. Ever since his parents have been away for business trips and other important things, he has been riding on his motorcycle from relative to relative. Nick arrived in Briarwood to live with his sister on the same day that evil was unleashed. He was the first to volunteer to rescue the old man's brother in the forest. However, Nick did not believe in magic or enough in himself to become a Ranger at the same time that the others did. It wasn't until he had a vision of the other Rangers being badly beaten by Koragg the Knight Wolf that he returned to save them and accepted both the magic and his responsibilities. He now possesses a strong sense of determination and duty - it was he who first decided to fight the dark armies even without his powers in ""Dark Wish"", and who encouraged the others to continue the final battle against Morticon.          Nick works at the Rock-Porium with the other Rangers and spends his spare time fixing his motorcycle. He never had the chance to make any real friends before moving to Briarwood and values the friendships he has - he was the first to befriend the troblin Phineas and was willing to surrender to the villain Oculous in order to save his friends. Although Nick isn't the type to hold grudges and is noted for his honour in combat by Daggeron, he makes an exception for Koragg. The Knight Wolf had repeatedly used magical telepathy to draw Nick into combat and the two had become constant rivals; during ""Dark Wish"", Nick attempted to fight Koragg even though he possessed no magic or Ranger power. Nick has found he can use the connection in reverse, contacting Koragg. His anger regarding Koragg was strong and he once tried to fight Koragg even when he had no magic to help him. Upon discovering Koragg was really Udonna's husband and long-lost hero Leanbow, he refused to believe that his enemy could be on the side of good and was enraged by a suggestion that he was like Leanbow. He was also quite jealous of Daggaron because he was the frog whom Maddie kissed unknowingly. Nick fancied Maddie!          Nick was adopted as a baby and never knew his birth parents, and he keeps the red blanket his baby self was originally wrapped in for sentimental reasons. He took a while to open up to the Rangers about this. In ""Heir Apparent, Part II"", it was finally revealed that Nick is Bowen, the long-lost son of Leanbow and Udonna, who had been taken to the human realm by Phineas for safe-keeping. He is also ""The Light"" - the child of the most powerful warrior and the most powerful sorceress, with the potential to destroy the Darkness forever and the primary target for the Ten Terrors. He is currently facing conflicting emotions over the discovery and subsequent disappearance of his father and the knowledge that he was Koragg - he has said he doesn't care about Leanbow, but alone with Phineas he showed that this was not the truth. His cousin is Clare, which made her mother Niella his deceased aunt.          In the finale battle, Nick was possessed by the Master and was transformed into a new Koragg, destroying villages in the Briarwood forest. He fought his father, destroying Rootcore in the process, before Leanbow freed him from the spell by demorphing and refusing to fight, causing Nick's mind to fight off the spell rather than kill his father. He was pushed to the limit afterward, seeing Udonna captured, the world destroyed and his father briefly killed, but was convinced by Madison that he couldn't give up and that the Rangers needed him to keep fighting; he was able to wound the Master enough to force him to retreat and, in the last clash, led the Rangers in destroying him.          Soon after the final battle, Nick along with Udonna and Leanbow rode off into the sunset on motorcycles to see his adopted parents. Nick finally believed that Maddie only loved Nick. With hints of a possible romance with Madison, Nick promised Madison he would return to Briarwood for her, leaving her with his old baby blanket. He would later rejoin his teammates in ""Power Rangers Super Megaforce"" as part of an army of veteran Rangers who aided the Megaforce Rangers in their final battle with the Armada.          As the Red Mystic Ranger, Nick wields the power of fire. He is always the first to rush in, using actions before thinking. Several times, he has proven to have far more innate magical power than he should, such as when he instinctively knew the spell to re-seal Morticon in the Underworld, and once being able to tame Koragg's loyal horse Catastros which may be because Koragg (Leanbow) was his father. Nick's weapon is the Magi Staff Striker. His vehicles are the Mystic Racer and the Mystic Speeder. His Titan forms are the Mystic Phoenix and he also commands Brightstar. As the Red Legend Warrior, Nick gains the Mystic Lion Staff which allows him to use the Fire Storm spell and become the Mystic Firebird. He later gains the power to combine with Fire Heart to become the Red Dragon Fire Ranger, possessing enough power to bring down an army of Hidiacs and Styxoids.          Nick is portrayed by Firass Dirani.          Vida Rocca, or just ""V"" to her fellow Rangers, is Madison's sister and the Pink Mystic Ranger, ironic because she hates the color pink. Vida loves to DJ at the Rock-Porium, and is one of Madison's most frequent film subjects. Although she is very no-nonsense, often to the point of bluntness, Vida is kind, generous, and loyal at the core; she defended Madison when she was accused of being withdrawn, and she protected Chip from being picked on when they were at school. Though she initially joined the other Rangers in teasing Xander when he began turning into a tree, thanks to his abuse of Clare's Perfection Potion, Vida was genuinely concerned about him, and was the most active in seeking an antidote for his condition. Most notably, Vida was able to deduce that Matoombo was not truly evil and could be convinced to leave the Master. She then gave him a chance to kill her without a fight in order to make him realize his actions would harm people. By series end, Vida had apparently gotten over her dislike of the color pink, having dyed all her hair that color. She and her teammates joined the Megaforce Rangers and every other previous Ranger team in battling the Armada in ""Super Megaforce.""          As the Pink Mystic Ranger, Vida wields the power of wind. She has shapeshifting powers which allow her to conjure giant, butterfly-shaped ""Mystical Wings"". She usually rushes into battle, making her an effective fighter. She owns a Mystic Racer and can change into the Mystic Sprite, which serves as the Mystic Dragon's head. In this form, she can use her shape-shifting magic to become a ball for the others to attack the enemy with. As the Pink Legend Warrior, Vida gains the Mystic Lion Staff which allows her to cast the Whirlwind spell and allows her, Madison, Chip, and Xander to become the Mystic Lion.          Vida is portrayed by Angie Diaz          Charlie Thorn, known as ""Chip"" to his friends, is the self-proclaimed ""superhero expert"". He is considered a little odd because he loves fairy tales and phases in and out of reality. His affinity for superheroes had him wearing a superhero costume to school on several occasions, including to the prom. He was deemed by Madison as ""the perfect example of a non-human species,"" when she filmed him eating a pizza topped with chicken, pepperoni, cheese, and chocolate marshmallows. Chip is a fantastic archer, a member of the chess club at school, and a part of COUNTV - Containment Of Underworld Nocturnal Transylvanian Vampires. He is always cheerful and eager to learn all he can about magic, and began to idolize Daggeron during ""Soul Specter"". After the final battle, he was last seen telling fictionalized tales of his battles as a Power Ranger to ladies from both realms.          Despite their extremely different personalities, Chip has been close friends with Vida ever since she stuck up for him when they were children. When she was turned into a vampire, he showed a far more serious and intense side of himself in his attempts to save her, including taking on Koragg and Necrolai by himself. He is extremely passionate about being a Ranger, taking it much harder than the others when they failed to save people from Gnatu and berating Nick/Bowen for betraying everything they stood for when he wanted to surrender to Oculous. He later joined the Ranger army in ""Super Megaforce"", battling alongside his teammates to face the Warstar Armada's last army.          As the Yellow Mystic Ranger, Chip wields the power of lightning. His main weapon is the Magi Staff Crossbow. He owns a Mystic Racer and his Titan Form is the Mystic Garuda, which becomes the wings for both the Mystic Dragon and Titan Megazord. As the Yellow Legend Warrior, Chip gains the Mystic Lion Staff, which allows him to cast the Lightning Bolt spell and allows him to join with Vida, Madison and Xander to become the Mystic Lion.          Chip is portrayed by Nic Sampson. Also he is the childish one amongst them.          Xander Bly is an Australian who now lives in the United States. When he first arrived, he was bullied mercilessly about his accent and was often ostracized. Consequently, he understands and sympathizes with loners. He is an adept skateboarder and enjoys showing off when he rides. Xander will use his charming smile to his advantage every chance he gets, and when faced with trouble, he will employ what he calls ""Plan Xander"", which is nothing more than trying to sweet talk his way out of the situation. Unfortunately for him, ""Plan Xander"" has been unsuccessful against Necrolai and other minions of Morticon.          Xander works alongside his fellow Rangers at the Rock-Porium, where he prefers to assign tasks to his co-workers, rather than to actually work himself; he refers to this as ""supervising"". He briefly clashed with Daggeron when the latter became the Rangers' mentor, seemingly out of the blue. Xander's overconfidence and inflated ego have gotten him into danger on several occasions, but his willingness in owning up to his mistakes has earned him several spell codes. After the final battle against the Master, he was promoted to manager of the Rock-Porium.          As the Green Mystic Ranger, Xander wields the power of the earth and can call upon the Mystic Muscles, magically bulking up his muscles to gigantic proportions. His weapon is the Magi Staff Axe. He was the first Mystic Force Ranger to use the Mystic Force Fighters spell code and also owns a Mystic Racer. Xander's Titan form is the Mystic Minotaur, which makes up the bulk of the Mystic Dragon and Titan Megazord formations. As the Green Legend Warrior, Xander gains the Mystic Lion Staff which allows him to cast the Rock Slide spell and allows him to join with Vida, Madison, and Chip to become the Mystic Lion.          Xander appeared alongside former Power Rangers Tori Hanson, Kira Ford, Bridge Carson, and Adam Park in the 15th anniversary special ""Once a Ranger"" (an episode of ""Power Rangers Operation Overdrive""). When the new villain Thrax disabled the Operation Overdrive Power Rangers' link to the Morphing Grid, Xander was one of five Rangers summoned by the Sentinel Knight to defend Earth in their stead. He was the first of the veteran Rangers to make his entrance, ensnaring Mig the Fearcat in a mass of vines. He later attempted to use ""Plan Xander"" on a group of Chillers when he and the veteran Rangers were ambushed by them at Angel Grove and was, not surprisingly, unsuccessful.          During the climactic battle with Thrax and his allies, Xander teamed up with Will and Dax against the Fearcats. He drew the attention of the Fearcats, using the Mystic Force Fighters to deflect their laser blasts before punching the villains to the ground, giving Will and Dax the openings they needed to use the Drive Slammer and Drive Vortex for the win. After the Rangers' victory, he told the Operation Overdrive Rangers that they were welcome to drop by the Rock-Porium anytime, and he would give them a 10 percent discount. He and his teammates later joined the final battle against the Warstar Armada in ""Super Megaforce.""          Xander is portrayed by Richard Brancatisano.          Madison Rocca, sometimes called ""Maddie"", is Vida's sister. She is also Nick Russell's love interest. Dubbing herself ""the sister with the common sense"", Madison is a budding filmmaker and prefers to express herself by filming people on her video camera. Because of this, many people, including Leelee and Nick, tease her about ""hiding"" behind her camera (which Nick later regretted doing when Vida called him out). Madison is studious and shy, and rarely has fun in the conventional way. Despite this, she has shown herself to be one of the more open and friendly of the Rangers; she was the first of the group to reach out to Nick, and was also the one who talked a disgruntled Jenji into coming home. She had harbored a phobia of frogs ever since Vida put one down her shirt when they were children and overcame that fear when she kissed a frog that had saved her from Jester the Pester; the frog reverted to his true form, Daggeron, the Solaris Knight. Madison worries that she is not a vital part of the team, but deep down, she has a true passion for protecting people and it was this that kept her battling against Magma when the rest of the team had fallen. When Nick wanted to give up in the face of the Master's power, Madison refused to let him and told him they needed to keep fighting. It is also shown in the series that she and Nick have budding feelings towards each other, and at the end of the series he left her the baby blanket that had served as his only link to his biological parents for years and promised he would come back for it.          As the Blue Mystic Ranger, Madison wields the power of water. She is usually not the first to engage an enemy, but is a competent fighter nonetheless. Her main weapon is her Magi Staff. She also owns a Mystic Racer and can morph into the Mystic Mermaid. As the Blue Legend Warrior, Madison gains the Mystic Lion Staff, which allows her to cast the Tidal Wave spell and allows her, Vida, Chip, and Xander to become the Mystic Lion. She and the other Mystic Rangers later joined the veteran Rangers in ""Super Megaforce.""          Madison is portrayed by Melanie Vallejo.          Udonna is the White Mystic Ranger. She was a powerful and talented sorceress whose people fought in the Great Battle against the forces of darkness, which ended with the evil forces being cast into the Underworld. She lost many of her friends in the Battle, as well as her entire family (except her niece Claire); her sister Niella was a powerful sorceress called the Gatekeeper, who sealed the Underworld at the cost of her life, while her husband Leanbow was left inside the Underworld trying to hold the enemy back and her infant son Bowen went missing during the Battle. After this, she prepared for the return of the forces of darkness and built Rootcore deep within the forest near Briarwood; when an earthquake broke the seal and freed the evil forces in present day, she recruited the five Mystic Rangers and gave them their powers.          As the White Mystic Ranger, Udonna commands the power of snow and could become a giant version of herself (not a Mystic Titan like the other Rangers). However, she is defeated in battle by Koragg, who claims her Snow Staff and her Ranger powers along with it. She currently mentors and trains both the Rangers and her niece and apprentice Clare (who became the Gatekeeper of the Underworld upon her mother's death) in the ways of magic. Udonna eventually discovers that Bowen is alive and was taken to the human realm by Phineas, and later still discovers that Nick is Bowen. Udonna is later captured and held a prisoner in the Underworld. While in her cell, she manages to channel the energies of her Snow Staff to help the Rangers fight Morticon. Afterwards, Koragg prevents Udonna from reclaiming her Snow Staff. Udonna then states that she can only feel pity for Koragg and teleports out of the Underworld.          When the Rangers are sent to the Underworld in ""Heir Apparent"", Udonna uses dark magic to rescue them, even though according to Clare, this would mean she would permanently lose all her magic. She is able to save the Rangers, but is then badly hurt by the Master, only surviving due to the actions of Koragg, who is then revealed to be Leanbow. After the revelation, she is considerably weaker, and it may be true that due to her use of dark magic that she is now merely human. She is left distraught when she sees her husband turned into Koragg once more, but the discovery that Nick is Bowen rekindled her belief in magic and she is able to free Leanbow once again. Despite his apparent death against the Master, she believes him to still be alive and leaves the Rangers to go on a quest to find him (starting in ""The Light""), with Clare as her companion. When she and Clare reach the Lake of Lament, they are confronted by Hekatoid, who knocks Clare unconscious and kidnaps Udonna, and put her under a spell to make her unconscious.          The other Rangers attempt to deal with Hekatoid, but it proves useless when he steals their powers. During this time, Leelee, Clare, and Phineas sneak into the Underworld to rescue Udonna. While they can do nothing to help her at first, Leelee produces the Snow Staff (stolen from her mother) and the trio use it to revive Udonna. Udonna, now morphed and with magic once again, reappears in Briarwood and the six Rangers combine their powers to defeat Hekatoid once and for all.          In ""The Return"", Udonna astral projects to find Leanbow in the Underworld. There, she finds him unconscious and uses the power of her Snow Staff to revive him. In the finale, she fights Sculpin personally, although she tries to reason with him and both are sent to the Underworld. However, Udonna is rescued by Necrolai and Itassis. She helps the other Rangers in destroying the Master. In the end, she goes with her husband and son on motorbikes to visit Nick's foster parents. For unknown reasons, she not appear as part of the Ranger army in ""Super Megaforce.""          Udonna was portrayed by Peta Rutter.          Daggeron is a no-nonsense warrior who trained under Leanbow, and due to this claims to have been ""trained by the best."" During the Great Battle, he was tasked to take baby Nick/Bowen to safety and was attacked by Calindor. The two of them fought viciously and were dually cursed, ending up sealed in a cave for nineteen years and with Daggeron turned into a frog. When the seal was broken and Madison kissed the frog in gratitude for saving her life, Daggeron reassumed his human form once again. At Udonna's request, he took the Mystic Rangers under his wing, training them to reach their full potential in a tough yet fair manner. He is also a wizard on par with Imperious, and stands alongside Nick as one of the only warriors to defeat Koragg in one-on-one combat.          Daggeron and Imperious are bitter enemies because of their past. In ""Heir Apparent"", Daggeron accepted Imperious' challenge at the Dimension of Wandering Souls to finish what they started 19 years ago, but this was a trap, and Imperious stole the Solar Streak Megazord's power in order to use a forbidden spell to create the Chimera which seemingly destroyed Daggeron. Thanks to Jenji, Daggeron survived and rode the mystical unicorn, Brightstar, to help the Rangers before settling things with Imperious for good in a Bound Battle to the death. Imperious cheated and wounded Daggeron, but through his determination and honor, Daggeron was able to destroy his old enemy.          When Udonna left to find Leanbow, he oversaw the Rangers' activities until her return. He gained a new nemesis in Megahorn of the Ten Terrors, being almost killed by him in their first battle before playing a key role in bringing him down in ""The Snow Prince"". He was killed by the Master in the final battle, but was revived by Necrolai at Leelee's behest. Itassis then approached him, seeking knowledge of courage. Daggeron would go on to join his students in the final battle with the Warstar Armada in ""Super Megaforce.""          As the Solaris Knight, Daggeron wields the power of the Sun and owns a feline genie named Jenji. In battle, he can convert Jenji's lamp into a blaster called the Solaris Laser Lamp which, in addition to always hitting its intended target, can launch Jenji forth in a bright stream of light in a finishing move called the ""Jenji Shining Attack"". He was also seen with a sword in one episode when he was in his Mystic Mode. Daggeron pilots the Solar Streak train, which can transform into the Solar Streak Megazord. He uses a Magic Carpet to get around Briarwood, sometimes racing on it with the Mystic Racers. Daggeron also has an Ancient Mystic Mode like Leanbow. He first used it in battle with Imperious, and used it to defeat him. However, despite the power of the Mystic Mode, it was ineffective against Megahorn before Daggeron found out his weak spot.          Daggeron is portrayed by John Tui, who also portrayed Anubis Cruger in ""Power Rangers S.P.D.""          Leanbow is Udonna's husband, Nick's father, and the mentor of Daggeron and Calindor. He was known for his honor and valor which Calindor resented. As a Mystic, he can assume ""Ancient Mystic Mode"", resembling a red/purple fiery demon wielding a sword and shield. Twenty years prior to the series, Leanbow led the other Mystics in the Great Battle against the Supreme Master of the Underworld, and his Forces of Darkness led by Morticon in order to prevent them entering the human realm. The forces of good magic eventually forced the Forces of Darkness through the Gate of the Underworld, with Leanbow personally taking on Morticon at one point. In order to keep the Forces of Darkness from escaping the Underworld, he held back the Darkness hordes from the Gate while Niella the Gatekeeper sealed both it and Leanbow into the Underworld. In this single act, Leanbow would be lost to the Forces of Darkness and Niella would use up the rest of her powers as the Gatekeeper, giving up her life force in the process.          For twenty years, Udonna and the others thought that they had lost Leanbow forever, killed in the battle that ensued behind the gate. But in reality, Leanbow had survived to reach and seal the Master - but before he fell, the Master was able to transform his enemy into his most loyal minion, Koragg. Though devoid of the memories of his old self, Koragg retained a few aspects of his previous life such as honor manifest in refusal to destroy a foe he considers to be weaker, citing such an action as a waste of his time and energy. In ""Koragg's Trial"", he revealed that he felt it was important to be honorable because only an honorable warrior could be trusted to serve the Master faithfully.          This also allowed him to tame the wild horse Catastros, which became Koragg's personal Zord and gave him the ability to form the Centaurus Wolf Megazord and combine with Catastros to gain a centaur-like appearance.          Koragg was the first villain released after years of imprisonment when the seal of the Underworld was cracked by the earthquake that hit Briarwood. Upon engaging Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger, who seemed familiar to him, in battle, he bested her and stole her Snow Staff but spared her life.          Koragg often openly dueled with Morticon in a power struggle, shows contempt toward Necrolai, and bowed to no one except the Master. He has also lied to Morticon, keeping the Megazord power he stole from the Rangers for himself and claiming it was gone instead of using it to free Morticon. Despite this, however, he proved to be a loyal servant of the Master and a persistent antagonist for the Rangers. However strong the Rangers got, Koragg was always stronger, with the Master personally giving Koragg more power every day.          When Imperious succeeded in transporting the Rangers to the Underworld, during the 2-part ""Heir Apparent"", so he could use their Legend Warrior powers to revive the Master, Udonna attempted to stop it only to be attacked by the Master himself. After an onslaught of forgotten memories flooded his mind, Koragg came to their aid at the last second. With the evil influence that had bound him now broken, Koragg revealed himself to be none other than Leanbow, shocking everyone present. He transported everyone out of the Underworld but despite that, Nick refused to trust him and viewed his reappearance to be ""one of Koragg's tricks"". Leanbow revealed his past about how he was transformed into Koragg by the Master, but when he absorbed the Virus that Imperious used on the Manticore Megazord to save them, it caused a unique side effect that caused him to regain his memory bit by bit. Leanbow was quickly taken back to the Underworld and transformed into Koragg again, leading to a final confrontation between him and Nick. He was on the verge of killing the Red Ranger when Udonna intervened and revealed that Nick was, in fact, their son Bowen, and the knowledge of this freed Leanbow from the Master's spell once more. The reunion was short-lived as the Master began to tear his way out of the Underworld and Leanbow, using a spell to prevent Udonna and the Rangers from intervening, travelled back to the Underworld to fight and seal the villain once again. With his Mystic Force Fire Strike attack, he sacrificed himself to bring down the Master and nearly all of the Underworld.          While he appeared to be dead, Udonna firmly believed he ""will return"" and has gone on a quest to ""bring him home"". Her belief is confirmed in ""Hard Heads"" when the villainous Terror, Sculpin, scried to see what was preventing the resurrection of the Master. At the Lake of Lament, it was revealed that Leanbow is responsible for preventing the Master from being resurrected. Now Leanbow wears Koragg's violet Knight Wolf armor, but still fights on the side of good, stating ""I wear the armor of Koragg, but my heart is that of Leanbow"".          In ""The Snow Prince"", Sculpin confronted Leanbow at the Lake of Lament taunting him with images of Megahorn's rampage. Leanbow refused to leave his post, but Sculpin persisted and showed Nick being injured during the battle. Nonetheless he still refused to come out of hiding. It wasn't until Sculpin raised the stakes and dispatched Black Lance to assist Megahorn did Leanbow finally leave his post and join the Rangers in battle. Leanbow appeared in the form of the Knight Wolf Centaur and engaged the chariot-riding Black Lance in battle. Leanbow eventually destroyed Black Lance's chariot and then transformed into the Centaurus Wolf Megazord. Maintaining the upperhand, he had Black Lance under control. Meanwhile, Necrolai appeared and planted onto the Centaurus Wolf Megazord a fish scale Sculpin had given her. Leanbow returned the underworld, purposely dragging Black Lance down with him. As he departed, Leanbow told the Rangers that he was proud of them and to continue the fight.          In ""Light Source,"" Leanbow (still wearing the armor of Koragg) hid himself deep within the depths of the Underworld within a crystal-like barrier. Since one of Sculpin's fish scales was on him, Leanbow was discovered by Necrolai, who then informed Sculpin and the other Terrors of his whereabouts. Sculpin, Gekkor and Matoombo then went to Leanbow to personally fight him and to retrieve the Master's spirit from his body. Gekkor was the first to fight Leanbow, using his lightning speed to give him an edge. But Leanbow was able to weaken Gekkor by slashing him in the stomach with his Knight Saber, then summoning a Mystic Force Fire Strike attack to weaken him. This was when Sculpin stopped Gekkor from fighting and sent Matoombo to fight him. Matoombo was able to give Leanbow an even greater challenge, using his superior strength to bring Leanbow to his knees and to shatter his shield. This left Leanbow open for Sculpin to stab him in the back with his trident and extract the Master's spirit from his body, causing Leanbow to revert to his Ancient Mystic Mode. Sculpin then used his trident to create a fissure in the ground and send Leanbow plummeting into it, but before he fell too far, Leanbow grasped an outcropping, hanging on for dear life.          In the episode ""The Return,"" Leanbow joins forces with the Mystic Rangers. While the Legend Warriors are facing Gekkor of the Ten Terrors in battle, Udonna finds and revives Leanbow using her good magic. The Legend Warriors find themselves overpowered, and are spared from certain doom once Leanbow appears and absorbs a flame attack Gekkor fired at them. Utilizing a new red Morpher, Leanbow transforms into the Wolf Warrior, a new form in which he bears armor almost exactly the same as Koragg's with the major difference being its crimson color. After displaying this new form, Leanbow quickly defeats Gekkor.          Leanbow was forced to face Koragg again when the Master (attempting a pre-emptive strike) turned Nick into a new Koragg and used him to destroy villages in the Briarwood forest. The battle between Leanbow and the new Koragg devastated Rootcore before he freed his son by demorphing and allowing himself to be killed without a fight causing Nick's mind to break free of the Master's control. He then went with Daggeron to the Mystic Realm to face the Master, only to have his magic drained and be killed in battle. Revived by Necrolai, he joined in the final battle against the Master and helped overload him with good magic. In the aftermath, Leanbow joined his wife and son in leaving Briarwood to visit Nick's adoptive parents. Like his wife he was absent from the final battle of ""Super Megaforce"", though his powers were employed by Silver Megaforce Ranger Orion.          Leanbow is portrayed by Chris Graham.          Little is known about the supernatural beings known as the Ancient Titans, but they seem to be the source of the Mystic Rangers' powers. They appear during the Rangers' morphing sequence and when the Titan Megazord uses the ""Titans Attack"" finisher.          The Ancient Mystic Titans are symbolized by mythological creatures from various Earth mythologies:          The Snow Prince and the Mystic Mother also appear to be Ancient Mystic Titans and there have been four other characters that also have forms that appear to be Ancient Titans, but are called ""Ancient Mystic Modes"".          Niella was the Gatekeeper of the Underworld and Udonna's sister, Nick Russell's aunt, and Leanbow's sister-in-law. When Leanbow went into the Gates, he told her to seal the Gate with a spell, in which she sacrificed herself to make the spell work. Only her daughter Clare remains. Like Clare, Niella had an Ancient Mystic Mode dubbed the ""Shining Moon Warrior"". Clare for a long time believed she was more incompetent with her magical abilities unlike Niella. This was until Udonna admitted that her mother was about the same way when she first started.          Niella (like Clare) was portrayed by Antonia Prebble.          The Snow Prince is an Ancient Mystic Titan and possibly the source of Udonna's powers. Long ago, he was mentor to all the Mystics including Leanbow. Currently, he resides in a parallel dimension he calls ""The North."" For one day, he allowed Nick to teach Daggeron rather than vice versa. This was actually to teach Daggeron how to follow his instincts, as Nick does. The Snow Prince also helped aid the rangers in fighting Megahorn and seemed to be a capable combatant in his own right. However, he noted that his powers were far weaker in our dimension than they were in his own. Thus, he used a spell attack called the ""Ancient Spell Seal""—similar to the Titan Megazord's ""Mystic Spell Seal"" attack—to suck Megahorn into the North, however temporarily. After Daggeron finally learned his lesson, Snow Prince graciously allowed him to join the fight against Megahorn and then returned to his own dimension. In the finale, ""Mystic Fate, ""he was sent back to the human realm by the ""Mystic Mother"" severely hurt to forewarn them of the impending disaster.          The Snow Prince is voiced by Paolo Rotondo.          The Mystic Mother, the ""Empress of All Good Magic"", is a colossal Ancient Titan-like being who rules over the Magic World and who first appears in the finale episode ""Mystic Fate"". Udonna has stated that in the ""dark days"", the Mystic Mother was known as Rita and that she had turned to Good Magic after being purified by Zordon's Energy Wave. The Mother herself remarked that she knew ""firsthand the weakness of Evil,"" and told the Master that he was giving her a headache. She was overwhelmed by the Master and seemingly killed, but was later revealed to have secretly escaped to regroup making Clare a ""full"" sorceress as she did. Her demeanor is that of a somewhat complacent, smug, but powerful enchantress. She is shown dressed in white much like other fictional heads of wizardly societies.          She is portrayed in Japanese ""Mahou Sentai Magiranger"" footage by Machiko Soga, the same actress who portrayed Bandora in ""Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger"" and thus Rita Repulsa in the first season of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"". Mystic Mother was voiced by Susan Brady. Her headache and the other details mentioned above imply that she and Rita Repulsa are one and the same.          The Mystics were five warriors that fought in the Great Battle against the forces of darkness, each symbolized by their own color and elemental affinity. They were led by Leanbow, the Red Mystic. The names of the Yellow, Blue, Pink, and Green Mystics' identities are unknown, and it appears that all but Leanbow perished during the Great Battle. The Power Rangers presumably replaced them to complete the second Great Battle.          In ""Heir Apparent, Part I,"" viewers were able to get a clear view of the Mystics. Leanbow was the Red Mystic; the Yellow, and Green Mystics were also men; the Blue and Pink Mystics were women.          Toby Slambrook is a human in Briarwood that owns the ""Rock Porium"" music store where he employs the five core Rangers, unaware of the team's secret Ranger identities. He sometimes helps the Rangers in their battle against the undead without realizing that he has done so. He usually provides the Rangers with his own brand of humorous advice, and defended Nick when the others believed he stole money from the store. He is known for his musical knowledge and references, as well as for being a major fan of fictional rock-n-roller ""Jake Bonebreaker"". Although Toby may seem slow-witted, he is actually a good puzzle solver, though he sometimes seems slightly obsessive and can easily be distracted by the mention of a riddle he has yet to solve. Despite not being a wizard, he unwittingly seems to have a lot of contact with the magical world outside of Briarwood. He was seemingly the only one who heard the Solar Streak's engine when Daggeron transported the other Rangers. He is also notable for being the one who solved the puzzle leading to the Fire Heart. Toby was once mistaken for being the Gatekeeper, and once met and escorted Phineas to the dentist.          When Imperious used Jenji to create a world where the Power Rangers did not exist, it allowed the forces of darkness to conquer the world. In Briarwood, music was outlawed, but Toby secretly kept a small music box for his own amusement. Upon being caught by Necrolai, he was to be taken to the mines. Hearing him plead for help, Nick led the other Rangers to fight back. This convinced the Tribunal of Magic to reverse Imperious' wish, thus restoring the Rangers' powers.          In ""The Light"", Toby seemed suspicious of his employees' disappearance; therefore he hired Leelee to fill in their place. In ""Light Source II"", the Rangers were finally ready to tell him their secret. However, when he asked them to morph as proof, they explained that a powerful villain called Hekatoid had stolen their powers, which he disbelieved. According to him, the 'real' Power Rangers would handle the situation, thus once again helping the Rangers without realizing it. Ultimately, he did happen to see them morph after they regained their powers. By ""The Return"" he had complete knowledge of the Rangers' task.          Later, Toby hires Phineas to work in his shop, which proves disastrous when customers are frightened by Phineas' appearance. Toby reluctantly dismisses Phineas to keep his business intact. During the final battle, Toby had convinced the humans of Briarwood that the spirits of the nearby forest were not their enemy, and that the two populations shared a common foe; this being the Master of the Underworld. The faith of the two populations in the Power Rangers re-created the Rangers' magic, which had been nearly destroyed, enabling them to overwhelm and annihilate the Master. After the battle, Toby rehired Phineas and hired several other spirits to work in his shop. He also began dating the reformed (and now human-looking) Necrolai.          In the """" episode At All Cost, Toby was referenced as the record-store owner who sold the dragon scale from to for use with the Defender Vest.          Toby is portrayed by Barnie Duncan.          Phineas is a Troblin (a half-troll, half-goblin creature) who roams the woods outside of Briarwood in the magical realm where he was rejected by humans, spirits, and even the trolls and goblins. He first appeared saving Clare from the Hydra Worm and later met Nick, whose friend he became. It was Phineas who told Nick that Necrolai and Koragg serve an even greater evil called the Supreme Master of the Underworld. Phineas befriended the other Rangers when Nick and Catastros were trapped in another dimension and later helped all the Rangers on their quest for the Fire Heart, during which he displayed impressive acrobatic skills.          In the episode ""Scaredy Cat,"" Phineas is taken to a human dentist so as to have his teeth attended. He was escorted by Toby who believed that Phineas was ""Xander's uncle from the Old Country"". At the dentist's office, Phineas is revealed to have eighty-three teeth of which not all are his. Phineas was later escorted to the Rock Porium by Toby, where became a fan of rock music after hearing it for the first time. Phineas is a little clumsy and has a dry sense of humor, but is quite cunning.          Whereas Phineas' origins and early history are not entirely known, he seems to have a strong connection with the Mystics and the Great Battle. He has told Clare that he was present during the war between the Mystics and the forces of the Underworld and personally witnessed Calindor's betrayal of Daggeron; later, in ""Ranger Down"", Phineas admitted to Daggeron and Udonna that, during Daggeron and Calindor's battle, he took Udonna's baby Bowen to the human realm for safety.          In ""Dark Wish,"" Phineas found Koragg insensate after the latter was defeated by Fightoe and 50-Below. Phineas seemed to have a little respect for the dark knight, which he showed by attempting to give him a eulogy. (Even someone bad had a redeeming quality, such as Koragg's honor, it's the right thing to do to try honoring their memory with a speech.) He was about to take Koragg's Wolf Saber when the knight, revealed to be alive, woke and frightened him. Koragg, too injured to save himself, asked Phineas for help, to which the half-breed reluctantly agreed. When Imperious used Jenji to create a world wherein the Power Rangers did not exist, it created a new timeline wherein Koragg and Phineas were allies. Koragg was aware of the legend of the five Mystic Warriors, of which he told Phineas. When Koragg sent the Rangers to the dimension where the Tribunal of Magic could be found, he broke his alliance with Phineas, who seemed saddened to say goodbye to his ""friend"".          Later, after the Ten Terrors had revealed themselves to the surface world, it was Phineas who revealed to Nick that he was the being known as ""The Light"", the son of the mightiest Mystics, who had the potential to single-handedly vanquish evil. In ""The Hunter"" just as Oculous was about to open fire on Nick, Phineas saved the Ranger from an oncoming bullet and convinced him to not give himself up, based on the premise that all life would be lost if the Light should fall.          In the episode ""Light Source"", Phineas met Leelee, with whose outcast status he sympathized. During their conversation, Leelee decided that she would rescue Udonna, who had been captured by Hekatoid; Phineas decided that he would tag along. On their way, they encountered Clare, who achieved common ground with Leelee and joined the rescue effort. The three of them infiltrated the cave where Udonna was held and freed her from Hekatoid's entrapments. Before they could free her, they were surrounded by foot soldiers; Phineas singlehandedly defeated these, revealing in its use his prodigious strength, which is implied to have been the cause of Leelee's infatuation with him. Because Udonna was in a catatonic state, the trio used the Snow Staff— stolen from the villains by Leelee— and a spell to reawaken her. At a gathering held after Hekatoid had been defeated, the three had become fast friends and rejoiced over the days' successes.          In ""The Return,"" he came to the Rock Porium with flowers for Leelee, whose sweetheart (according to her) he had become. The Rangers then gave Phineas a (possibly temporary) job at the store, which he lost when his strange appearance frightened customers. In the final battle, Phineas gathered together the denizens of Briarwood's neighboring forest, convincing them that humans were not their enemy and that the true threat originated from the Master of the Underworld. The combined faith of the two populations re-created the Rangers' magic, which had been depleted, allowing the Rangers to overwhelm the Master of the Underworld. Phineas, among others, was later hired by the Rock Porium.          Phineas is portrayed by Kelson Henderson.          The Fire Heart was an item sought by both the Rangers and the villains, which the Rangers eventually found and took back to Rootcore, where Udonna revealed that it was the last Dragon egg. According to a book in Rootcore that told about dragons, it said that the baby dragon could only be hatched by forcing the egg open with a hammer; a tactic of which Clare did not approve. When Jenji was released in ""Scaredy Cat,"" he told the Rangers that it must be sat on to hatch. Clare did so; therefore when the dragon was released, it came to call her ""Mama"". She is later shown nursing him.          In ""Ranger Down,"" Jenji took Fire Heart into the forest and abandoned him out of jealousy. Phineas eventually found him, and took care of him for a brief amount of time, even going so far as to sentimentally name him ""Phineas Jr."" or ""P.J."" for short. Because of Phineas' care, Fire Heart called Phineas ""Daddy"". When Phineas lost the dragon, he wandered the forest, looking for 'Phineas Jr.'. He ran into Clare in the process; when the two realized that they were searching for the same dragon, they looked up to see him, now grown to a massive adult size. Due to the fact that he has taken a liking to both Clare and Phineas, Fire Heart more than likely considers the two to be his parents.          When Imperious used Jenji to create a world wherein the Power Rangers never came into their power, it created a new timeline wherein Koragg was the egg's discoverer and dragon's keeper. Because of the new timeline, the dragon did not recognize the Rangers and breathed fire at them when they came too close. Koragg then used a spell to calm or tame the dragon and convince him to work with the Rangers. Fire Heart was revealed to have the power to enter the Tribunal of Magic's dimension, whereupon he did so. On the way there they were attacked by Necrolai, whom Fire Heart vanquished after a fierce aerial battle. After landing the Rangers in the Tribunal's dimension, Fire Heart quickly abandoned them. When the timeline had been restored to its original continuity, Fire Heart worked with the Rangers as if nothing had been otherwise.          In ""The Hunter,"" it is revealed that Fire Heart has the power to combine with Nick's Legend Warrior Mode to form the Red Dragon Fire Ranger.           In the """" episode At All Cost, Fire Heart is referenced by as the source of the dragon scale needed for the Defender Vest. The scale was sold to him by Toby Slambrook. Before it was augmented to the Defender Vest, Fire Heart's scale was stolen by Moltor and Volcon to make Volcon even stronger, but was reclaimed by the Rangers.          A powerful, quick-talking, cat-like genie, Jenji is an old friend of Udonna's and of the other Mystics.          Long ago, Jenji was the most powerful and popular cat in his homeland. Everyone liked him except the Cat King of the land named Rexigan. The jealous King Rexigan had a witch cast a spell over everyone making them believe Jenji had become evil and as a result, Jenji was banished. Later, Daggeron found the nomad Jenji among many riches he had found. Though Daggeron advised him against it, Jenji opened a mystical box that was actually an evil trap, almost destroying himself in the process. Daggeron saved his life by putting him inside a lamp, which changed Jenji into a wish-granting genie. A side-effect of these abilities is that Jenji is bound to the lamp, only able to roam free for two hours at a time, after which he begins to disintegrate into dust. However, it seems that Jenji can be reconstituted if returned to his lamp before disappearing completely.          Daggeron used Jenji's lamp as the key element in sealing himself and Calindor within a sea cave; once the Rangers found the lamp, they broke the seal. Jenji is somewhat cowardly despite his powers and retreated from Imperious in his first appearance, though he eventually managed to overcome his fear. He has the power to grow to the same colossal size as Imperious, as well as turn into an energetic form to be used as Daggeron's finishing move, the ""Jenji Shining Attack""; Maddison also used this attack when she saved him, with the normal birght light replaced with bubbles. Despite his goofy personality, Jenji is a capable fighter. He uses his claws in battle and has a technique he dubbed the ""Super Cat Attack"" wherein he relentlessly assaults his opponents with claws and kicks. When Calindor reappeared, Jenji tried to warn the Rangers and Udonna of Calindor's betrayal, but was unable to complete the warning when Calindor dropped a pile of books on top of his lamp. Because of his past banishment, Jenji is extremely needy of affection and therefore has been jealous of Fire Heart. In ""Ranger Down"" in a comic scene, Jenji meets Piggy in a dumpster in a Briarwood alley whereupon Piggy states that ""In twenty years, this place will be crawling with aliens!"".          In ""Dark Wish,"" the Rangers wanted to use Jenji against the Four Barbarian Beasts although Daggeron insisted that this was not to be done. When the Rangers fought Fightoe and 50-Below, Daggeron gave in and used Jenji's Shining Attack against the two monsters. However, Fightoe captured Jenji using his magic staff and brought him to the Underworld, where Imperious released him. Being a genie, Jenji was forced to grant his wish: that the Mystic Force Power Rangers never existed. This allowed the forces of darkness to conquer the world. Although Jenji's magic was powerful, it proved reversible by the Tribunal of Magic. When the world was restored, Leelee found Jenji's lamp and released him when he told her that she would receive one wish. As she contemplatively bit her nails, he warned her that she ""shouldn't do that"". Leelee moaned and told him that it was a ""nervous habit"", saying that she wished she had never started biting them. Jenji granted this at once; while Leelee's nails grew almost 6 inches long, Jenji fled to the safety of Rootcore.          In ""Hard Heads,"" he was temporarily turned to stone when Serpentina's snakes bit him, whereupon she activated her shield. Upon Serpentina's destruction, he was returned to normal. Jenji later served as supervisor in the ""Bound Battle"", a duel wherein Imperious and Daggeron fought to the death. He was briefly killed by Sculpin in ""Mystic Fate"", but returned to life along with Daggeron.          Jenji is voiced by Oliver Driver.          The Tribunal of Magic was a group of three powerful, cloaked beings visited by the Rangers in the ""Dark Wish"" trilogy, who ensure the existence of magic and reside in a separate dimension.          The Rangers begged the Tribunal to reverse Imperious' wish and restore color and positive magic to the world. The Tribunal denied this request and returned the Rangers to their altered dimension. When Toby was dragged away by a group of Hidiacs and Styxoids, the Rangers attempted to help their friend and fought hopelessly against the monsters. The Tribunal of Magic then decided that this courage deserved a reward, and restored the world to its former state. The Rangers, now morphed, continued to fight the Hidiacs, only to be defeated by 50-Below and Fightoe. When the Rangers realized that they had taken their magic for granted, the Tribunal of Magic decided to give the Rangers a reward and bestowed upon them the spell code for Legend Mode allowing the Mystic Rangers to become the Legend Warriors.          The red Tribunal member was voiced by Michael Morrisey. The black Tribunal member was voiced by Stuart Devenie. The white Tribunal member was voiced by Elizabeth McRae          Leelee Pimvare is the teenage daughter of Necrolai. Previously a frequent shopper at Rock-Porium, of which she later became an employee. While part of the Morlocks for most of the season, she has recently abandoned them for a normal life. Her father was turned into a worm by Necrolai.          It is unclear if she too is a vampire, as she looks human. She has also shown to be a fairly adept fighter, perhaps even on par with her mother, though Necrolai hinted that Leelee's time amongst humans— three months as of that meeting— had made her soft. Both the fact that she was able to fight hand-to-hand with Necrolai and the fact that she is implied to have lost strength lends credit to the theory that she is a vampire, however there is the possibility that she is a Dhampir (half-human, half-vampire), which can fully explain her abilities and human appearance. Aside from these facts, she seems like the average teenage girl. Leelee may have a crush on Nick, as she has flirted with him. She often seems to be vain or obnoxious toward the Rangers.          Leelee has been known to be extremely selfish and trouble-prone, as when she tried to frame Nick for theft so that he be fired from his job and would have time to spend with her. For a period, she took a more active role in the forces of darkness' plotting, such as luring Vida to Flytrap's club so that she would be turned into a vampire under Necrolai's control, aiding Morticon in his attempt to locate the Gatekeeper. Leelee seems to have an uneasy relationship with her mother, who forced her to try to enter a cave to find Imperious' mummy, although evil beings were unable to enter. In addition, when Leelee was turned into a bug by Imperious, Necrolai refused to do anything about it, and when Necrolai gained magic she also transfigured Leelee. Despite that, Leelee appears to have some degree of love for her mother and sounded upset at the thought of leaving her. She also tends to be somewhat incompetent, as in her release of Jenji and her myopic wish that she had never bitten her fingernails.          In ""Heir Apparent,"" the Rangers were captured and discovered she was one of the members of the Forces of Darkness. She showed a desire to keep the Rangers as ""pets"", but also showed concern as to their condition after their powers were drained. Thereafter her mother, Necrolai, took an extreme interest in the Book of Prophecy. Leelee decided that she could no longer continue her evil ways; angling to make friends, she left the Underworld to work alongside the Rangers at the Rock Porium. Nick initially intended to tell Toby Leelee's secret, but the other Rangers stopped him. Leelee promised that as long as they kept her secret, she would keep theirs. The Rangers are extremely distrustful of her until she proves herself to be a diligent worker.          In ""The Hunter,"" Leelee had been left to mind the store. When the Rangers returned after a battle, they found her exhausted and the Rock Porium clean. She was therefore named ""[best] employee of the month"".          In ""Hard Heads,"" Leelee felt miserable and lonely; between the Rangers' distrust of her and her mother doting on the Terrors, she seemed to have no one in whom to confide. At the end of the episode, she read the ""Book of Prophecy"", hoping that her future might cheer her up; however, she was instead horrified to discover that she would apparently become ""Queen of the Vampires"".          In the two-part episode ""Light Source,"" she went up against her mother, defying her destiny to be the Vampire Queen. Leelee helped Clare and Phineas enter the Underworld to find Udonna, who was imprisoned there. They used their combined magic to set her free and energized her using the Snow Staff. Leelee was therefore finally accepted as a friend by the Power Rangers and their allies. In the later episode ""The Return"", Leelee confirms a rumor planted in ""Light Source"" that she had made Phineas her paramour.          In ""Mystic Fate,"" her mother defected to the side of good to protect her. Afterwards, the two moved into a Briarwood condo. Phineas remained Leelee's sweetheart, though his open-hearted demeanor apparently prevents any of the then-conventional awkwardness from taking hold.          While Leelee first revealed her full name in ""Broken Spell,"" not until ""Light Source"" did she point out that her surname was an anagram of ""Vampire"" implying that it may be an assumed name.          Leelee is portrayed by Holly Shanahan.          Clare Langtree, is a fictional character from the television series ""Power Rangers Mystic Force"". She is a human sorceress in training, is offbeat, clumsy and bumbling, yet never gives up. She is both niece and apprentice to Udonna, the sorceress. She once feared that she was far worse with magic than her mother Niella, but has recently discovered she was just as clumsy as Clare when she first started practicing magic. Keeping the ties of ""Mystic Force"" with its source series ""Mahou Sentai Magiranger"", Clare could be considered a less serious version of Heavenly Saint Lunagel, in which both are empowered by the Moon and have the duty of guarding the gates to Underworld/Infershia.          Clare was originally just a comic relief character, with her poor spellcasting abilities serving as her gag. It was later revealed she was the heir to the role of the Gatekeeper, and that her mother had died using her powers to seal the Morlocks within the Underworld. As the Gatekeeper's daughter, Clare was the only one who could undo the seal. Udonna had promised to keep her from harm and to only give her the Gatekeeper powers when she was ready, but the machinations of Morticon forced Clare to inherit the powers early. Donning a mystical tiara that granted her the Gatekeeper powers, Clare proved herself to be highly courageous and powerful, taking on evil with determination and focus in her desire to rescue a captured Udonna. She weakened Necrolai and took away the Vampire Queen's new powers, but did not come out so well against Koragg. Beaten, she was used to unlock the gate to the Underworld and unleash Morticon's forces. With Nick's help, she was able to get free and used up the last of the tiara's powers to seal the gate once more.          Even with the Gatekeeper powers gone, she still is an important ally to the Rangers and continues to resiliently work on her magic. She was responsible for hatching the baby Fire Heart, which imprinted on her as its mother, and took care of it as an infant. Even after Fire Heart grew up and is now many times her size, Clare still cares for it.          Since Udonna lost her powers after using a powerful dark magic spell, Clare has recently become a much more competent sorceress, joining Udonna on her quest to find her husband, Leanbow. When the two reached the Lake of Lament, however, Hekatoid, one of the Ten Terrors, appeared. He knocked Clare unconscious and proceeded to kidnap Udonna.          In ""Light Source,"" she, Phineas, and Leelee, traveled to the Underworld to rescue Udonna. While they could do nothing to help her at first, Leelee produced the Snow Staff, stolen from her mother, and the trio used it to revive her. After this, Leelee, Phineas, and Clare returned to Rootcore with the newly reenergized White Ranger.          During the final battle in ""Mystic Fate Pt. II"", the Mystic Mother grants Clare the power of a Sorceress. After Udonna leaves Rootcore with Nick and Leanbow, she becomes the new Sorceress of Rootcore, turning the Xenotome to its final page in the last scene and successfully performing the vanishing spell that she was unable to accomplish in the first episode.          She is portrayed by Antonia Prebble.          The fictional villains of ""Mystic Force"" are demonic beings that dwell underground, known as the Forces of Darkness; they were also referred to as the Morlocks in promotional material, though this reference was never made in the show. Originally, the Forces of Darkness attempted to take over the magical world with their sights set on the human realm as well. But Leanbow, the strongest wizard of those to challenge them, cast a spell to banish them into the Underworld, sealing them for all eternity in a noble sacrifice. Years later, the seal was cracked and they resumed their campaign to finish what they had started.          All members of the Forces of Darkness appear in footage imported from ""Mystic Force""'s source material, the 2005 Super Sentai ""Mahou Sentai Magiranger"", in which the characters comprise the Underground Hades Empire Infershia (albeit with different names). An evil Ranger appeared in this season and sucked the energy of darkeness she was the evil blue ranger called HLC.          The Supreme Master of the Underworld (AKA Octomus) is the main antagonist of ""Mystic Force"" and the true leader of the Forces of Darkness and his minions revere him so much that he has only ever been referred to by his title. He contacts his minions via the white pool at the center of their lair, which turns red to signal his presence. His true form was revealed to be an immense Cthulhu-like demon with a skull-like face, many tentacles and dragon heads on the end of each tentacle, but usually only his right eye can be seen. His other eye is embedded in Koragg's shield, and one of his fangs was used to make Morticon's sword (which was taken by Koragg when Morticon was destroyed and forged into a new Knight Saber) and quite possibly some of his claws were given to Necrolai, her ""Claws of the Master"".          He was sealed in his Pit by the efforts of Leanbow at the end of the Great War, when the Forces of Darkness attempted to invade the Surface Realm, but he was able to transform his enemy into his most loyal servant Koragg the Knight Wolf beforehand. He was also responsible for dragging Catastros down to the Underworld. With the Forces of Darkness active once more, their sole motivation is to free their Master.          The Master has often had to intervene to stop his minions squabbling - in one case, Koragg was placed on trial before him, accused of being a failure to the villains' cause, and he made his verdict in Koragg's favor. He also created Imperious out of the mummified remains of Calindor.          To gain the Master's favor after his attempts at usurping him had failed, Imperious proposed the idea of feeding the Ranger's Legend Warrior powers to him, giving him the power to enter the surface world. But when Udonna's interference almost got her killed by the Master himself, Koragg stopped him at the last second and was turned into Leanbow once more. The Master was able to partially emerge onto the surface before Leanbow pulled off the ultimate sacrifice, seemingly destroying himself and the Master. However, the Ten Terrors were confident that by following the Rules of Darkness, they could bring about Master' resurrection.          Nevertheless, in ""Hard Heads,"" a monkey wrench was thrown into the Terrors' works. Sculpin learned that Leanbow, still stuck in the body of Koragg, seems to be somehow preventing the Master's resurrection from beyond the grave. Later, Sculpin located Leanbow in the Underworld, and extracted the Master's spirit, giving it to Gekkor for safe keeping. In ""The Return,"" the Master ultimately chose Matoombo as his vessel and was restored to having a physical body by tearing his way out of Matoombo's body and molding it into his own evil image of a skeletal fallen angel-like beast with a skull-like face, a black mask that concealed his hideous brain and numerous tentacles. He also had two additional eyes on his skull-face to replace his original right eye.          In his final bid for power in ""Mystic Fate,"" the Master first possessed Nick Russell directly and transformed him into a new Koragg - one more sadistic and vicious, who laid waste to parts of the forest and Rootcore before he was saved. While the Rangers were distracted by this, the Master personally went to the Mystic Realm and seemingly destroyed , source of all good magic, and when Leanbow & Daggeron arrived to face him he devoured their Knight powers and killed them. Following this, he personally went to Briarwood and attacked the Rangers directly, hurling them into a vision of the future where he had succeeded in destroying the Earth before devastating the Manticore Megazord, devouring part of their magic, and sending the Rangers fleeing.          His victory seemed certain - Nick was able to wound him and have the Rangers sent back to the real world, but at the cost of their magic. However, the Master was undone when it was revealed Itassis & Necrolai had defected from him (causing the resurrection of Daggeron & Leanbow), the Mystic Mother was still alive and both the people of Briarwood and the forest had gathered against him. Regaining their magic from people's belief in them, the Mystic Force Rangers used the Master's devouring of good magic against him by overloading him and causing his destruction.          The Master was voiced by John Leigh in his second form (he never spoke in his original form).          The former general and leader of the dark army, Morticon appears to be an undead cyborg, with the machinery that comprises the bulk of his body fused to what remains of his blue skin, somewhat similar to Dr. Victor Frankenstein's monster. He is known to use a mystical portal to view the world and wields a sword made from one of the Master's fangs. He possesses Herculean strength, able to hurl the Mystic Dragon (with the Mystic Phoenix riding it) with one arm with relative ease and because of his strength and skill in battle, especially with his sword, he considers himself to be the ""Most Powerful Warrior of All Time"".          He initially couldn't leave the Pit because Koragg's magic wasn't strong enough to free him, although he briefly broke through to the surface in giant form when Koragg robbed the Mystic Titans of their Megazord power and used it to free him. However, Nick quickly used a counter-spell to imprison Morticon once more. Morticon had a very short temper, he desperately wanted out of the Underworld and frequently attacked Koragg to get him out. Morticon has also been seen blasting a Styxoid into thin air, and can be very intimidating to the villainous Necrolai. He and Koragg never got along, and have gotten into fights on two occasions.          He was freed again to battle the Power Rangers in ""The Gatekeeper"" Pt. II. He proved very powerful and was once again in his giant form when he appeared, easily defeating the Titan Megazord uses his own form of the Dark Magic Strike. He batted away the Mystic Dragon with his sword while Nick went to rescue Clare. He was eventually defeated when the Rangers formed the Titan Megazord and, with the help of Udonna, destroyed him. All that remained after that was his sword, which Koragg found and claimed for himself.          Morticon was voiced by Andrew Robertt.          Necrolai is the ""Dark Mistress of the Underworld"" and ""Queen of the Vampires"". This evil spy is frequently disrespected by Koragg and Morticon who constantly call her a ""hag"". She can fly and usually scouts the area for Morticon. Necrolai is usually the one who brings up monsters and thinks up the schemes. She is a formidable fighter in her own right and has battled the Rangers occasionally. Due to her status as Queen of the Vampires, she is not adversely affected by garlic or sunlight. She was once obliterated by the power of the Dawn Crystal, but managed to reassemble herself during a half moon later that night. Despite her early claims of immortality, she does seem to fear Morticon and, to a lesser extent, Koragg, which would explain why she puts up with their behavior and rarely talks back to them. She showed true fear when Morticon threatened her after her repeated failures against the Rangers. After Morticon was destroyed, she brought the mummy of Calindor from the cave to the Underworld, releasing Imperious.          Necrolai is ambitious, callous, and egocentric; what she does, she does for her own benefit, intending to rise to a position of power. She however is a capable fighter in her own right, even holding her own against the entire Mystic Ranger team on occasion, without the assistance of magic. Much like Scorpina before her, she takes few if any hits during battle. Being afraid of Morticon, she will not seek to rise alone beyond a certain point, but attempts to raise her own status by backing the Master.          Necrolai is also Leelee's mother. The father is seldom mentioned where Necrolai has claimed that she changed him into a worm. Necrolai seems to have little or no regard for her daughter, doing nothing to help Leelee after Imperious turned her into a bug. Necrolai herself transformed Leelee into a bug, testing out the purple Mystic Morpher's powers. After Morticon's death, she had a minor panic attack over the loss of her leader and expressed to the Master that she did not trust Koragg to lead, and when Imperious arrived, she tried to flatter him into favoring her.          In ""Ranger Down"", Necrolai received Koragg's magic in the form of a purple Mystic Morpher, but in ""Koragg's Trial"", Koragg took his magic back to challenge the Rangers' new Legend powers. After pleading his case to the Master, his magic was officially returned to him, and Necrolai was once again without magic.          After Leanbow freed the Rangers from the Underworld, Imperious weakened him, allowing Necrolai to capture Leanbow and bring him back to the pit where he was once again turned into Koragg by the Master.          After the destruction of the Pit and Imperious, Necrolai was shown having a few doubts about her current role, but the discovery of the Book of Prophecy changed all that - ignoring her daughter entirely, she followed the Book's instructions and provoked the Ten Terrors into attacking the Surface. She now appears with Gekkor on excursions to the surface world.          Recently, Necrolai placed a scale on Leanbow, that was given to her by Sculpin, so that the Ten Terrors could track him down and extract the Master's essence from him. They were successful in doing just that.          Necrolai seems to have an inferiority complex with regards to the Ten Terrors as well as a slight fear of them. She believes that by following their orders she will spare herself any wrath they may inflict on her by beckoning to their whim, obeying them more so out of fear than just out of respect for their rank to the Master.          While Necrolai normally seems like she doesn't care about Leelee, it is revealed in ""Mystic Fate"" that she does care - when Itassis was told to destroy all humans by the Master, Necrolai begged her not destroy Leelee. While Itassis was willing to do so (due to Necrolai's loyalty to the Master), Sculpin demanded Leelee die with the humans as punishment for living with them. As a result, she betrayed the Master to revive Itassis, as well as the dead Leanbow, Daggeron, and Jenji. In the process, she was turned into a human.          Soon after the final battle, she started dating Toby (who called her ""Nikki"") and both she and Leelee apparently moved into a condo.          Necrolai was voiced by Donogh Rees. Nikki was portrayed by Brigitte Berger, but voiced by Donogh Rees.          Koragg the Knight Wolf is an armored warrior that is loyal to the Supreme Master of the Underworld. He is somewhat similar to the werewolf and the person who serves as his host has a Jekyll and Hyde personality.          Referring to himself as the ""Dark Wizard of the Underworld"", Imperious sees magic as a way to grant his own selfish desires. He was formerly a friend of Mystics' named Calindor, he himself one of the Mystics in the Great Battle. Fed up of following Leanbow's teachings and corrupted by dark magic, he betrayed the others and tried to take Bowen to the Underworld. He battled Daggeron over the baby, resulting in both combatants being cursed and sealed in a cave. Nineteen years later after Morticon had been destroyed, Necrolai tricked the Rangers into breaking the seal and retrieved the mummified Calindor. The Master brought him back to life as the mummy-like Imperious to serve as the new leader of the Underworld, a role Imperious took an immediate liking to. Imperious was easily annoyed by Leelee's complaining, turning her into an insect. With the ability to summon and free monsters (including himself) from the Underworld, Imperious wasn't hindered by a focus on escaping the Underworld like Morticon was, and focused more on direct attacks on the civilians of Briarwood.          In ""Long Ago,"" Imperious briefly reassumed his previous identity as Calindor to gain Udonna and the other Rangers' trust, intending to poison Udonna, frame Daggeron as the traitor and steal the Xenotome. Luckily, Clare worked out his true nature and found out from Phineas he was the traitor just in time to stop Imperious from poisoning Udonna, and Daggeron prevented him from stealing the Xenotome and rendering the Rangers powerless. After that, he began seeing Daggeron as a personal rival.          In ""Ranger Down,"" he dared Koragg to fight without magic, relying on only his physical strength. Koragg agreed, and his magic was turned into a purple Mystic Morpher that was given to Necrolai. Unbeknownst to Koragg, this was just the first step in a much larger plan - to destroy the Master and rule the world on his own. In the next step of Imperious' plan, he released the four Barbarian Beasts. Warmax and Shrieker were sent to battle the Rangers first, wearing them down, while he secretly dispatched both Fightoe and 50-Below to take out Koragg so he couldn't interfere. Imperious then sent them to battle the Rangers, knowing that their laziness and battle fatigue would cause them to summon Jenji - at which point Fightoe captured him and took him to the Underworld, where Imperious used Jenji's power to wish for a world where good magic and everything related to it didn't exist, rendering the Rangers powerless. This allowed the forces of darkness to conquer the world - Rootcore was reduced to rubble and the Rock Porium vanished, color was nonexistent, humanity was enslaved and music was outlawed. One thing Imperious hadn't counted on was that Koragg had survived and plotted against them, helping the Rangers to reach the Tribunal of Magic and reverse Jenji's wish, after which 50-Below was destroyed. After the battle, Imperious scolded Fightoe for fleeing from battle and destroyed his body and then used Fightoe's soul to power the war machine monster, Ursus, which was also destroyed.          Imperious later attempted to convince the Master that Koragg was incompetent and a traitor in order to get rid of the warrior once more, but failed. Realizing he was unable to destroy the Master as long as Koragg was around and scared of his treachery being found out, he decided to get into the Master's good books instead by raising him out of the Underworld with the Ranger's Legend powers. To that end, he formulated a plan by separating Daggeron from the Rangers and destroying him, while using his power to create the Chimera to help drag the Rangers down into the Underworld; Udonna's interference and Koragg's transformation back into Leanbow freed the Rangers, but the Master was still rising. Imperious was on the verge of triumph when it was discovered Daggeron had in fact survived. Imperious challenged him to a bound battle - the two, in their Ancient Mystic Modes, would be chained together and fight with only swords. Imperious cheated, snatching the Solaris Laser Lamp for use and mocking the idea of fighting with honor. Despite this, Daggeron was able to win and mortally wounded his enemy. Imperious regressed back to Calindor and then into the mummified shell of himself before dissolving to dust as he made a cryptic remark about the coming of Ten Terrors.          Imperious is a skilled fighter and extremely powerful, as well as supremely arrogant. He balances out his physical strength with magical powers, which is the same kind of magic as the Mystic Rangers' only to a higher degree, and he is willing to use forbidden magic (such as to create the Chimera) and can free banished monsters. He carries around a Folding fan that he also uses as a weapon as he can use it to send magical spells and it can also become a staff that can be used in battle. He can grow to a size more than one hundred times the size of the Titan Megazord. In his first encounter, he easily defeated the Rangers, and only Jenji's surprise attack and the fact his magic hadn't yet returned to full strength (due to being stuck in the cave) drove him back. Despite his new form, he can return to being Calindor at will and use his old Ancient Mystic Mode. In his Ancient Mystic Mode, he uses a Mystic Sword similar to the one that Daggeron uses and that both used during their final duel, and was able to fight him evenly matched, showing that he hadn't forgotten any of his old fighting skills.          Coincidentally, Imperious is Latin for ""controller.""          Calindor was portrayed by Will Hall while Imperious was voiced by Stuart Devenie.          The Ten Terrors of the Underworld are a Pantheon of ten god-like demons/monsters and the most powerful servants of the Master. They supposedly only existed in the worst of nightmares but were discovered by Necrolai in ""The Light"", dwelling in the Lower Sanctum of the Underworld. They are all normally giant in size, especially in their lair but they can change their size at will to match the height of the Rangers. They are adamant about upholding the Laws of Darkness and are willing to kill each other (and be killed) for transgressing them; it appears that if they ""don't"" follow the Rules, there will be dire consequences for them and they may be banished. Their cardinal law is that those who oppose dark magic are to be punished. They appeared on Earth to demonstrate their power and announce themselves. They each wield a different kind of weapon.          In their lair stands a giant stone monolith known as the Stone of Judgment which projects a ball of light that passes over the Ten Terrors, stopping on the weapon of whoever is chosen to punish Earth next, however, in the first part of ""Mystic Fate"" the Stone of Judgment is destroyed when The Master used it as a portal into the Underworld, causing it to shatter. They wait for their Master's return and resurrection. Although they easily decimated the Rangers and their Megazords in their first appearance, the Terrors were less successful in individual attacks on the surface world. Nearly all of the Terrors were destroyed, the only Terrors that survived were Itassis and Matoombo as they both eventually defected to the side of good, (although both of them were destroyed at one time, Matoombo was destroyed when Sculpin struck him down and the Master was reborn in his body and Itassis was slain by the combined strengths of Black Lance and Sculpin).          Magma was the first of the Ten Terrors chosen to fight the Mystic Force Power Rangers while Udonna left to find Leanbow. He was an Ifrit (a type of fire genie) who used a club with a ball and chain as his weapon. He shoot out fire from his club, and fire out a spiral blast form fire form his chest. For defense, he can create a shield of heat that can stop almost anything but water-based attacks, although he's durable enough survive the Rangers' Legendary Warriors United Formation attack. When he was sent to punish humans on the surface, he lit a radio tower to show how much time the people had left before he punished them with an attack called ""Volcanic Force"". He offered to play a game with the Rangers, lighting another radio tower on fire and saying that if even one Ranger was left standing when the tower burned down, the Rangers would win. Magma beat the Rangers fairly easily, but Madison's passion of wanting to save the people of earth compelled her to use a powerful Tidal Wave attack, causing Magma pain. Out of anger Magma grew to giant size to battle the megazords. He was unaffected by the Manticore Megazord's Striker Spin Attack in this giant form, but as he was about to pummel the Rangers, the other Terrors noticed that the tower had burned out; Magma had lost the game. Itasis threw his trident at Magma, destroying him. In his dying breath, Magma foreshadowed the challenges the Rangers had to face with the Ten Terrors before he was turned to stone and was destroyed.          Magma was voiced by Greg Smith.          A red-eyed robotic Cyclops, Oculous is the sharpshooter of the Ten Terrors and is known as the ""Cunning Hunter"". He used a sniper rifle with a bayonet as his weapon. When Necrolai first entered the lower sanctum where the Ten Terrors dwelled, he was on the verge of firing on her with his sniper rifle, calling her an ""eyesore"", before Gekkor intervened. He possesses the power to demolecularise whatever he shoots at and can access another dimension from which he can fire at any target he wants wherever it is.          In ""The Hunter,"" he became the second Terror chosen by the Stone of Judgment to challenge the Rangers, offering to spare their lives if they sacrificed Nick, The Light. The Rangers refused and attempted to escape, but Oculous easily took out Vida, Madison, Xander, and Chip from his other dimension, leaving Nick wounded and desperate. When Phineas told Nick to look into his ""heart"", Nick summoned Fire Heart and combined with him, summoning the Mystic Battlizer and becoming the Red Dragon Fire Ranger. Nick defeated numerous Hidiacs & Styxoids before firing at Oculous, destroying him, and making his friends rematerialized.          Oculous was voiced by Andrew Laing.          Serpentina is a Medusa-like Gorgon monster with a mirror-coated shield (similar to the Aegis of Athena) for a weapon, which can deflect almost any attack. She is one of the two female terrors, and the slyest of the ten. She speaks in a hissing lisp. She has the ability to morph her lower body in a more serpentine shape (similar to a Nāga) and can shoot purple electricity from her mouth, a technique she calls the ""Snake Strike"". She also has the ability to send her enemies to her stomach, and the ability to transform herself into a giant snake and can summon many snakes (her ""children"") and when a victim is bitten by her snakes, she can activate her shield causing all who have been bitten to turn to stone.          In ""The Light,"" she openly said that the Master was growing incompetent. She also seems to not care whether the Master is revived and agreed with Megahorn, both were annoyed that the Terrors should follow the Rules of Darkness according to the Stone of Judgment.          In ""Hard Heads,"" she was the third to be chosen by the Stone of Judgment to face the Power Rangers. She had peered into the Book of Prophecy and realized it was her turn to be chosen, and so tricked Hekatoid to attack before her so that he would be able to get rid of the Rangers before she had to punish the humans. Although Hekatoid failed, he did manage to cast a spell on Nick and Vida that caused them to lose their ability to morph, giving the team a disadvantage. On her first appearance on the surface world, she fought Daggeron and the three remaining Rangers, who were forced into their Titan forms, due to Nick and Vida's inability to morph. Nick and Vida used a spell to knock her off balance, and Serpentina attempted to attack them when the other Rangers came to their aid. When Daggeron attempted to use Jenji's Shining Attack, Serpentina managed to get one of her snakes to bite Jenji and then activated her shield, turning Jenji to stone. She then challenged the Rangers by inviting them into her Serpent Dimension where she proceeded to swallow them in her giant snake form. She returned to the human world and set her sights on finishing the job by consuming Nick and Vida while they were still vulnerable, until Itassis intervened, reversing Hekatoid's spell on them. Nick then defeated Serpentina with his Battilizer, causing Serpentina to regurgitate the other Rangers. She then grew into her giant form and summoned her snakes all over Briarwood, but before any of them could bite, Daggeron used the Solar Streak Megazord's furnace blast to suck up Serpentina's shield, causing all of her snakes to vanish. The Rangers then destroyed Serpentina. In her last breath, Serpentina warned the Rangers that Megahorn would avenge her destruction before falling and exploding. Because of her destruction, the spell on Jenji was lifted and he was returned to normal.          Serpentina was voiced by Sally Stockwell.          Megahorn is one of the least willing to obey the rules and the most short-tempered. He also looks very similar to a Drake creature. He has an extendable neck and wings and bonelike armor equipped with what appear to be dragon skulls. While flying, he can fly as fast as the Mystic Dragon. He also wields a jagged sword which looks much like a dragon's tail. Despite Sculpin being the leader, Megahorn is the most powerful of the Ten Terrors and boasts the strongest attack and defense potential among them. By slashing his sword, he is able to create shockwaves or summon green fireballs (his fireballs can defeat the Maniticore Megazord in one blast). He also can summon strange black and purple spheres of dark energy. One of his most powerful attacks is the ""Lizard Laser"", where he blows a powerful blast of green fire from his mouth, and can also breathe powerful blasts of fire or fireballs. During this attack, he fires green lasers from his eyes strong enough to defeat the Solar Streak Megazord. Also, his armor is incredibly durable, able to withstand Daggeron's Ancient Mystic Mode's power, the Maniticore Megazord's Striker Spin attack, and even when the rangers were in Legend Mode and combined their powers with Snow Prince they couldn't hurt him. His armor isn't completely impenetrable, however, an area on the back of his neck was less durable than the rest of his body so it proved to be a weakspot that would lead to his downfall.          He, along with Serpentina, felt annoyed that the Terrors should follow the Rules of Darkness according to the Stone of Judgment. Believing that the Terrors should destroy their enemies at all costs, he is often frustrated by the Stone not picking him yet. He broke the Rules of Darkness once already in ""The Hunter."" Secretly going up to the surface without being chosen, he fought against Daggeron, who had been busy training with Jenji. He nearly succeeded in destroying Daggeron before Itassis intervened and forced him to leave. Still, Megahorn vowed that he will face the Solaris Knight again.          At the end of ""Hard Heads,"" Serpentina claimed that Megahorn would avenge her defeat.          In ""The Snow Prince,"" Megahorn was at last selected by the Stone of Judgment to attack the Surface World. He happily went, even showing the arrogance to rub it in Gekkor's face. The Rangers had little success against him when they fought him at first but Nick managed to reveal a weak spot on the back of his neck when he repeatedly attacked him. Megahorn, however, was able to revert the Rangers from Titan form and Ranger form altogether and prepared to finish them off when the Snow Prince appeared and battled him. Surprisingly, even outside of his dimension the Snow Prince managed hold his own with Megahorn, though the dragon eventually overpowered him. The Snow Prince then transported Megahorn into his dimension and he, along with the Rangers, battled him amongst the snowy plains. Daggeron, however, was excluded because the Snow Prince did not feel he had learned what he needed to know. Megahorn, however, still could not be defeated, easily and defeated the Rangers once again, along with the Snow Prince, and broke free from the Snow Prince's dimension. This was when Daggeron arrived and battled Megahorn himself, repeatedly attacking Megahorn in both his Ranger form (Solaris Knight) and his Ancient Mystic Mode in the same fashion as Nick did. He managed to rediscover Megahorn's weak point, on the back of his neck, and targeted that area and temporarily defeated Megahorn. This did not stop the dragon-like Terror, however, and he grew to giant size to battle the Rangers once more. It was at this time Sculpin sent Black Lance to assist him since he believed two Terrors would be far more successful than one (and it was secretly to draw Leanbow out) much to Megahorn's dismay, thinking he could handle the Rangers on his own. Black Lance was sent back to the Underworld by Leanbow and Daggeron continued fighting Megahorn in the Solar Streak Megazord. Then by holding Megahorn in place, the Manticore Megazord had the perfect opportunity to strike the back of Megahorn's neck, weakening him enough for Daggeron to finally finish him off by using the Furnace Blast to suck Megahorn in the Megazord's engine and destroy him. Although Megahorn never got along very well with the other Terrors save for Serpentina to some degree, they were shocked that the Rangers were able to defeat him.          Megahorn was voiced by Dallas Barnett.          Hekatoid is a gluttonous, turquoise toad monster that wields a hammer that also functions as a trumpet. When Necrolai first met the Ten Terrors, Hekatoid used the trumpet function of his hammer to blow her away. He speaks in a deep, wheezing voice, however, his voice is nowhere near as dark as that of Matoombo. He loves to eat, especially dessert foods such as cakes and donuts and he keeps a large table filled with these items in his personal lair. He is the shortest and fattest of the Ten Terrors. He also enjoys playing games with his opponents. By squeezing his warts, he can squirt various kinds of slime, one brand acts like an acid that is strong enough to dissolve concrete, another can prevent whichever of the Rangers it touches from morphing. He also has the ability to spit large gobs of explosive oily sludge at his enemies and can extend his tongue like a real frog to ensnare his enemies. He also has the ability to conjure huge clouds containing Poisonous Tadpoles (his ""babies"") that would eventually hatch and become Poisonous Frogs, and can also summon evil, black-necked doppelgangers of the Mystic Force Rangers themselves during one of his games. He is easily the weakest of the Terrors, possessing horribly weak stamina (Black Lance noted that he was out of shape), and is easily injured by any attacks the Rangers use.          In ""Hard Heads,"" Hekatoid was tricked into fighting the Rangers by Serpentina since she knew that it would be her turn to be chosen by the Stone of Judgment. He battled Nick and Vida and squirted them with a special slime by squeezing one of his warts, making them unable to morph. However, when the Selection Ceremony to choose Serpentina was underway, he was forced to retreat and return to the lair. Itassis was able to pry the information that Hekatoid was sent by Serpentina to give her an advantage in the next battle.          During ""Snow Prince,"" he continually expressed his concern about how the Terrors that were dispatched seemed to have a disadvantage against the Rangers and was amazed that Megahorn was defeated. At the end of ""Snow Prince"" he found Udonna and Clare at the Lake of Lament and attacked them, knocking Clare unconscious then using his long frog tongue to capture Udonna.          In ""Light Source,"" he was the fifth chosen by the Stone of Judgment to attack the surface world. When Hekatoid was chosen, he disliked and complained about having to work, and Matoombo scolded him because of his gluttonous and sloppy habits. Black Lance expressed some concerns that he felt that Hekatoid was not ready because he was greatly out of shape. Hekatoid planned to lure the Power Rangers to him using the captured Udonna as bait. He challenged the Rangers to a game where they had to battle a large group of Styxoids within a time limit, which they succeeded in doing. Next he sent them off to fight evil versions of themselves. When the Blue and Yellow Rangers were victorious, the Rangers got to fight Hekatoid himself to reclaim Udonna, but he refused to give up Udonna so easily and their battle took them from Hekatoid's lair back up to the surface. When it seemed that the Rangers finally got Udonna from Hekatoid's grasp, he used one of his sludge balls to send her away again. He also used his power to steal the Ranger's ability to morph, then fled back to his lair. Once there Hekatoid found out that Daggeron and Jenji were using the Solar Streak Megazord to suck up the Poisonous Tadpole eggs in the sky and went back to fight them as a giant. The Solar Streak Megazord used so much power in sucking up the eggs that it didn't have enough power to fight Hekatoid, and so, Hekatoid battled Daggeron on foot. By this time the tadpoles had matured into frogs and began raining down from the sky, but before they could reach the ground, the newly revived Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger used her ice magic to freeze and vaporize the frogs. Knowing Hekatoid was out of shape, the Rangers used their agility and endurance to tire out the toad and take back their Ranger powers. When their powers were returned, Udonna and the Rangers combined their magic to finally destroy Hekatoid.          Hekatoid was voiced by Charlie McDermott.          A spear-wielding Wyvern/Gecko creature that wears a visor, Gekkor stopped Oculous from shooting Necrolai with his rifle, willing to lend her an ear. He was also with her on the surface, watching the battle between Magma and the Rangers. Gekkor seems to be the fastest of the Terrors, able to move at lightning speed in battle. Utilising his speed, he was able to overwhelm all the Power Rangers plus Solaris Knight together. He is also able to shoot a barrage of needle-like projectiles and summon forth fiery green energy blasts from his spear. He was the first to mention that the Master was going to return. When Oculous was chosen to be the next to attack by the Stone of Judgment, Gekkor was curious (and seemed somewhat annoyed) that he himself was not chosen to carry out the punishment and was reminded by Matoombo that the Stone of Judgment is never wrong. In ""The Snow Prince"", when Megahorn was selected by the Stone of Judgment to attack the surface, the dragon-like terror boasted proudly about him being chosen and rubbed Gekkor's face in it, to which the wyvern replied: ""Whatever!""          In ""Light Source,"" Sculpin took Gekkor and Matoombo with him to get the Master's spirit from Leanbow. Gekkor battled Leanbow, using his lightning speed to his advantage against the knight. However, Leanbow was able to severely injury Gekkor by striking him in the stomach with his sword then using a fire attack on him. Gekkor claimed that he still could fight but Sculpin stopped him and ordered Matoombo to fight. Gekkor was irritated and jealous that Matoombo got to fight Leanbow. When Sculpin extracted the Master's spirit from Leanbow's body, Sculpin gave Gekkor his spirit to take care of.          In ""The Return,"" Gekkor was the most zealous in punishing the traitorous Matoombo and so he was dispatched to deal with Matoombo, who managed to elude him with the help of Vida and Xander. Gekkor was desperate in his chase, following Vida and Matoombo on board the Solar Streak Megazord and into the Dawn Woods, demonstrating his great speed. However, when he finally caught up with Xander and Matoombo, it turned out that Vida transformed into Matoombo to distract the wyvern-like Terror. Gekkor fought the six main Rangers and nearly swiftly defeating them with a large sphere of green energy, his full power, at them, almost assuring a ""Sweet"" victory. However, Gekkor was finally killed by the restored Leanbow as the Wolf Warrior with a Blazing Storm Slash. This made him the seventh Terror to be destroyed and the sixth to be destroyed by the Rangers. He was also the first Terror to be destroyed by the Rangers before being chosen to do so by the Stone of Judgment.          Gekkor was voiced by Mark Ferguson.          A powerful green-skinned titan gladiator with gray armor who has an afro-like hairdo and no visible eyes. He had an extremely deep voice. Matoombo referred to himself as the ""Energy Warrior of the Underworld"" and initially boasted of conquering the world. He wields a double-bladed staff and is the tallest of the Terrors. He is also one of the most physically strong, able to battle Leanbow and give him a challenge, as well as being able to break his shield and is formidable with his staff, able to defeat both the Titan and Solar Streak Megazords with only a one stroke. He has an air of wisdom about him, on par with Itassis, he reminded Gekkor that the Stone of Judgment is never wrong. In ""Light Source"", Matoombo scolded Hekatoid for being such a slob and a glutton after he complained about being chosen by the Stone of Judgment.          When Necrolai found Leanbow in the Underworld, Matoombo, along with Sculpin and Gekkor, went to seek out Leanbow to recapture the Master's spirit that Leanbow held within him. After Gekkor fought against Leanbow for a bit, Sculpin ordered Matoombo to fight him. Matoombo's strength was enough to give Leanbow a challenge, the Titan was even able to shatter Leanbow's shield with his staff, leaving him open for Sculpin to extract the Master's spirit from his body.          In ""The Return,"" Matoombo was the sixth Terror chosen to face the Rangers, and made it clear that he didn't actually want to harm anyone, apparently not realising, until then, that conquering the Earth would hurt people. He initially gathered up electricity to use against the Earth before realizing it. After watching him save a child from being hit by a car, Vida befriended him and convinced him to call off his attacks, and the electricity he gathered. Unfortunately by this point, Matoombo had also been chosen as the new body for the Master, and Gekkor was sent to retrieve him. This led to a protracted chase to an alternate dimension, where Vida (joined by Xander) managed to distract Gekkor long enough for Matoombo to reach the Sleeping Lake where he would slumber eternally, and thus prevent the return of the Master. Unfortunately however, before he could enter the lake, Sculpin appeared and killed him, thus allowing the Master to reassume a physical form, which he did by breaking through Matoombo's body.          At the end of ""Mystic Fate,"" Matoombo was somehow revived and was last seen DJing with Vida at the Rock Porium.          Matoombo was voiced by Cameron Rhodes.          Itassis is a Sphinx monster with eyeglasses and an arm-mounted bazooka in the shape of a lion's head. She's a very skilled hand-to-hand fighter, and her bazooka has immense power. The wisest of the ten and working for the Master in pursuit of knowledge rather than power, Itassis makes sure the other Terrors follow the Rules of Darkness - she was the one who stopped Megahorn from destroying Daggeron in order for him not to disrupt the Rules of Darkness. She also was the one who reversed Hekatoid's spell on Nick and Vida that prevented them from being able to morph so that Serpentina would follow the rules. In ""Snow Prince,"" she expressed surprise and concern when Sculpin began to break the Rules of Darkness himself by sending Black Lance to help Megahorn on the surface. Unlike the other Terrors and the Master, Itassis prefers peaceful means to end conflicts and hers is the way of knowledge.          In ""The Return,"" Itassis expressed surprise at the situation between Matoombo and the Rangers. After Vida escaped on the Solar Streak, she made a deal with the Rangers to assist them in return for knowledge - the answer to how, though the Terrors were stronger, the Rangers managed to defeat them time after time. The answer given was their courage, which led them to keep fighting for the sake of others, and she expressed confusion over why anyone would fight to defend a weaker being.          When the Master chose Itassis to destroy the Rangers, she displayed great power in easily defeating the team, including Nick as the Red Dragonfire Ranger, but was confronted by Madison and Nick that she was just a puppet of the Master. She realizes that the Master had been using her and changed sides. However, Black Lance and Sculpin defeat and destroy her after she declares that she will not serve Evil any more. In the end, Necrolai revives Itassis (since she was the only kind to her) and she finally defeats Sculpin. Proclaiming to the Master that ""this puppet has cut the strings"", she manages to weaken him and send him retreating. She also witnesses the destruction of the Master by the Rangers. Afterwards, she turns good and expresses to Daggeron that she is interested in learning more about courage.          Itassis was voiced by Josephine Davison.          Black Lance is a black knight-like monster (inspired by the legendary horse Sleipnir, evident because his breastplate resembles a horse's head) with a shield and lance and sometimes uses a thin, jagged sword instead of his lance. He also has a Chariot that he rides into battle with that is pulled by horses that appear to be smaller and differently colored versions of Catastros. He is also one of the most powerful of the Terrors, boasting incredible offensive power, able to defeat the Manticore Megazord with one stroke of his lance and also seems to be one of the fastest when he is riding his chariot, he can also shoot lighting from his lance. He has another attack when he leaps into the air and spins around like a screw and drives towards his enemies. His shield is also nearly indestructible. Black Lance seems to act as a war advisor to Sculpin, as well as his right-hand man.          When the Rangers attacked the Ten Terrors with the Manticore Megazord, Black Lance blocked the attack with his shield, then countered with his lance, easily defeating them. In ""Snow Prince,"" Sculpin broke the Rules of Darkness and ordered Black Lance to go to the surface world in order to help Megahorn battle the Rangers. Black Lance was delighted, saying that his stallions needed a little exercise despite Megahorn not wanting his help. Black Lance attacked the Manticore Megazord using his chariot. When it seemed that Black Lance would emerge victorious, Leanbow arrived in the form of Koragg's Knight Wolf Centaur and began attacking Black Lance. The knight accused the former Koragg of being a traitor and used the spikes on the wheels of his chariot to injure him. Leanbow then leapt onto Black Lance's chariot and used his sword to smash one of its wheels, causing the chariot to crash and break and flinging Black Lance away. Black Lance then battled Leanbow as the Centaurus Wolf Megazord, during this time Necrolai planted Sculpin's fish scale on one of the wolf figureheads on his right shoulder. Leanbow then overpowered Black Lance and used a teleportation spell to drag Black Lance down into the Underworld, where the Knight-like terror vowed that he would get his revenge on Leanbow.          In ""Light Source,"" he expressed concern about Hekatoid being sent to fight since he was out of shape.          In the finale, Black Lance assisted Sculpin in destroying Itassis for her betrayal. Then with a new chariot, Black Lance began attacking the surface world and soon began fighting the Manticore Megazord overwhelming it again. He appeared on the verge of victory before Nick, backed up with Fire Heart to form the Red Dragon Fire Ranger, beat him back, and the Rangers soon used their version of the Mystic Spell Seal to finish off Black Lance for good, making him the seventh and final Terror destroyed by the Rangers.          Black Lance was also the first Power Rangers monster to battle their Megazords more than once and never lose.          Black Lance was voiced by Derek Judge.          Lord Sculpin is the red fish man-like leader of the Ten Terrors with a trident for a weapon. His appearance is similar to both the Gill-man and Dagon and he has a fish for a head. Being the leader, Sculpin is most likely the most powerful of all the Terrors, his trident is an efficient weapon, able to strike down Magma, Matoombo and Itassis with it easily and can summon a flurry of fireballs from his trident when fighting. He also has the ability to shed his fish scales and use them as tracking devices. He is fanatically loyal to the Master, and doesn't even view it as his place to question orders.          When Magma failed to destroy the Rangers before the flame he lit burnt out, Sculpin hurled his trident through the portal created by the Stone of Judgment and destroyed Magma. He is extremely zealous about upholding the Rules of Darkness and has made it clear he will destroy anyone who breaks them, although this only because he thought following them would allow the Master to return. When he noticed that the Master showed no signs of returning, he became suspicious and went to investigate. He scried using the Lake of Lament to find out what happened to the Master. He realized that Leanbow was preventing the Master from being resurrected. Although this was a major hindrance to the Terrors' plans, Sculpin found the aspect ""fun"". He then plotted ways to lure Leanbow out in the open. He went back to the Lake of Lement and called Leanbow and showed him Megahorn's rampage and how strong he was against the Rangers. When Leanbow refused to help, Sculpin resorted to drastic measures. He deliberately broke the Rules of Darkness by sending Black Lance to the surface in order to assist Megahorn, feeling that two Terrors were far more difficult to handle than one. This strategy proved successful when Leanbow did appear on the Surface World. It was then that Sculpin gave Necrolai one of his fish scales to plant on Leanbow when he was battling Black Lance as the Centaurus Wolf Megazord. After Black Lance was sent back to the Underworld and Megahorn was destroyed, he expressed that Megahorn was a ""Hot-head that deserved to lose,"" then proceeded with his next plan to find Leanbow.          In ""Light Source,"" Sculpin gave Necrolai another one of his fish scales for her (and them) to use to track down Leanbow. When she found him, he brought along Gekkor and Matoombo with him to personally battle Leanbow. He first allowed Gekkor to fight the knight but when Gekkor was weakened, he order Gekkor to stop fighting and then sent Matoombo to take his place. After Matoombo shattered Leanbow's shield, this left him open for Sculpin to use his trident to extract the Master's spirit from Leanbow's body. Once Leanbow was ""exorcised"", Sculpin used his trident to create a fissure in the ground and send Leanbow plummeting into it.          In ""The Return,"" Sculpin's immediate goal of restoring the Master was realized after he personally slew his Master's chosen vessel, Matoombo, thus restoring the Master to a physical form.          In the finale, Sculpin and Black Lance destroyed Itassis for her disloyalty. Alongside Black Lance, he fought the Rangers viciously, kidnapping Udonna and temporarily killing Jenji. In the Underworld however, he was confronted by Itassis (who was brought back to life by Necrolai). The two fought but Sculpin was ultimately killed unable to stand against her new sense of courage. In his last breath, Sculpin vowed that the Master would avenge him and that the forces of darkness would be victorious.          Sculpin was voiced by Peter Daube.          The Hidiacs are one set of vicious zombie-like foot soldiers used by the Forces of Darkness. There is a ton of them that surround the center of the lair, in rows starting from the hole on the Earth's ground all the way down to the lair.          The Styxoids are more powerful versions of the Hidiacs used by the Forces of Darkness. They are more muscular and wear leather masks and vests and wield spears. They also possess the ability to speak and are sometimes used to command squads of Hidiacs and monsters.          The ones that spoke were voiced by Nick Kemplen and Jim McLarty.          These are the monsters used by minions of Octomus. To make a monster grow, the ""Uthra Major, Rise Up"" incantation must be said which then causes the monster to grow to giant size.","['Power Ranger teams', 'Fictional characters who use magic', 'Power Rangers Mystic Force']"

He was instrumental in putting down the Essex rebellion of 8 February 1601.          John Leveson, born 21 March 1555 at Whornes Place, Cuxton, Kent, was the eldest son of Thomas Leveson (1532–1576), second son of the London mercer Nicholas Leveson (d.1539) by Denise or Dionyse Bodley (d.1561), youngest daughter of Thomas Bodley (d.1493) and Joan Leche (d. March 1530). His mother was Ursula Gresham (1534–1574), one of the twelve children of Sir John Gresham, Lord Mayor of London.          Leveson had a younger brother, William Leveson (d.1621), one of two trustees used by William Kempe, Thomas Pope (d.1603), Augustine Phillips (d.1605), John Heminges (bap. 1566, d. 1630) and William Shakespeare (1564-1616) to allocate shareholdings in the Globe Theatre in 1599.          Leveson matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 10 January 1576, and studied for a time at Gray's Inn.          According to Wisker, Leveson was an efficient estate manager and 'an excellent public servant'. He was a close associate in Kent of William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham, and eventually one of the executors of his will. He was also a captain in Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby's 1589 expedition to France. He was knighted in 1589, and helped raise volunteers for three of Sir John Norris's expeditions in 1589, 1596 and 1601. He was a cousin of Sir Richard Leveson, and with him was involved in the shipment of 2000 soldiers sent to Ireland in 1601.          While riding to his house at the Blackfriars, London, on 8 February 1601 Leveson inadvertently became instrumental in suppressing the rebellion of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, taking command of a force on Ludgate Hill and placing a barrier across the street. Within half an hour Essex's men tried to force their way through, and in the resulting skirmish Essex's stepfather, Sir Christopher Blount was injured, whereupon Essex withdrew with his men to Essex House.          Leveson was a Member of Parliament for Bossiney in 1586, Maidstone in 1597 and 1601, and for Kent in 1604.          He died at Whornes Place on 14 November 1615, and was buried in the parish church at Cuxton on 22 November.          Leveson married firstly, on 27 April 1579, Margaret Manwood (d. 26 April 1585), the daughter of Sir Roger Manwood, by whom he had three daughters who died in the lifetime of their father.          Leveson married secondly, on 9 July 1586, Christian Mildmay (d. February 1627), widow of Charles Barrett by whom she was the mother of Edward Barrett, 1st and last Baron Barrett, and daughter of Sir Walter Mildmay, by whom he had five sons, three of whom died within the lifetime of their father, and five daughters, four of whom died within the lifetime of their father.

The municipal area comprises the villages of Ahrensfelde, Blumberg, Eiche, Lindenberg, and Mehrow.          Ahrensfelde, like the neighbouring village of Eiche, was first mentioned in the 1375 ""Landbuch"" (domesday book) survey executed for Emperor Charles IV, after he had acquired the Margraviate of Brandenburg two years before. The oldest village however is Blumberg, once a possession held by the Bishops of Brandenburg, which was first mentioned as ""Blumenberch"" in 1253. Blumberg manor was acquired by the poet and diplomat Friedrich von Canitz in the late 17th century, the castle was later rebuilt according to plans by Karl Friedrich Schinkel with a park designed by Peter Joseph Lenné. It was destroyed by the advancing Red Army during the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The art historian Adolf Bötticher was a native of Blumberg.          In 1908 the Ahrensfelde Cemetery was established by the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union as a multi-regional burial site outside of Berlin. Parts of the municipal area near Ahrensfelde station were overbuilt and finally incorporated into the East Berlin borough of Marzahn in 1990. The present-day municipality was established by the merger of Ahrensfelde proper with Blumberg, Eiche and Lindeberg on 26 October 2003.

46552416,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46552416,Peter Krausz,"Peter Krausz (born 1946) is a Romanian-born Canadian artist. Throughout his career, he worked within the fields of painting, drawing, installation, and photography and, since 1970, exhibited in museums and galleries across Canada, the United States, and Europe. He is best known for large-scale landscape paintings of the Mediterranean.          Krausz's landscapes, described as ""spaces halfway between the real and the imaginary"", convey man's interrelationship with nature. Identified by translucent, egg-tempera color and ""secco"" technique, in a review of the ""(No) Man's Land"" exhibition at Forum Gallery, Los Angeles, ""ARTnews"" critic Richard Chang noted, ""a luminosity that captured crisp light and clean shadows spreading across the island.""          Born in Brașov, Romania, in 1946, Krausz pursued art encouraged by his parents, artist and art-educator Tiberiu Krausz, and Judith Krausz, an art historian. From 1964 to 1969, he studied drawing, painting and mural techniques at the Nicolae Grigorescu Fine Arts Institute in Bucharest. In 1969 Krausz and his parents fled Communist Romania through Czechoslovakia and Austria into Italy. Described as a ""flight toward the unknown"" and ""escape across a Cold-War border"", this event inspired the ""Berlin Series"" (1988) and ""(No) Man's Land"" series (2009-2014). After a year in Rome, Krausz and his family emigrated to Montreal, Canada, in 1970. He exhibited there that same year, and solo exhibitions of his work were held at Galerie Malborough-Godard in 1976 and at Galerie Theo Waddington in 1979. From 1980 to 1990, Krausz was curator of the Saidye Bronfman Centre Art Gallery and taught in the Fine Arts Department of Concordia University. In 1991, he joined the faculty of the Université de Montréal, and is a tenured Professor of Fine Art in the Art History and Cinema Studies Department.          In 1984, Krausz participated in the important exhibitions ""Montréal tout-terrain"", and ""Vent et eau"" at the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, organized by Centre international d'art contemporain de Montréal (CIAC). Solo exhibitions of his work held at the Montreal artist-run galleries Optica and Articule, drew favorable press. In 1987 at the CIAC's exhibition ""Stations"", Krausz exhibited an installation and 70-foot drawing ""Archipelago"", inspired by Varlam Shalamov’s memoire of 22-years of forced labor in the Soviet Gulag ""Kolyma"". In 1989 this installation and the ""Berlin Series"" which referenced the construction of the Berlin Wall, were exhibited in a solo show at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, Ontario. In 1991, Krausz’s solo exhibition, ""Journeys"" at 49th Parallel Gallery in New York, was reviewed favorably by Frederick Ted Castle in ""Art in America"". This exhibition included the 14-painting series ""Night Train"", inspired by Claude Lanzmann's documentary ""Shoah"", now in the collection of the Jewish Museum (Manhattan). In 1992 Krausz’s installation ""Traces-mémoire"" was exhibited at the Centre d’art contemporain in Montpellier, France. Also exhibited in Montreal, the installation consisted of 250 lead panels, each etched with a name of a French town and date, from 535 to 1990, associated with an anti-Semitic event.          Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and Eastern Block, Krausz turned to landscape. To protest the destruction of the natural world, he chose as subject the Mediterranean, it's beauty and harmonious relationship between man and nature. By the time of his ""Landscape and Memory"" series (1996-1998), Krausz's signature style of rich, vibrant colors using a unique ""secco"" technique was evident. Solo exhibitions held at the Musée d’art de Joliette in 1990, and a subsequent series ""The Song of the Earth"", exhibited in 2004 at the Musée Régional de Rimouski, established Krausz’s critical reputation. From 2009 to 2014, the series ""(No) Man's Land"", which contrasted the beauty of Cyprus with a ""no man's land"" zone between the Greek and Turkish communities was exhibited at the Maison de la Culture Côte-des-Neiges (Montreal) and at the Ottawa School of Art (Orleans ON). Paintings in this series were also exhibited in solo shows at Forum Gallery (New York and Los Angeles), Galerie de Bellefeuille (Montreal), and Gallery Jones (Vancouver). Krausz also exhibited large-scale drawings including portraits at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 2013, and in Toronto at Mira Godard Gallery in 2012 and 2015, and John B. Aird Gallery in 2015.          Throughout his career, Krausz explored a variety of painting and drawing techniques, mediums and           surfaces including stretched and unstretched canvas and sculpted wood. In an early Optica exhibition, his concern for drawing and its integration within painting was noted. He explored various painting mediums and used iron-oxide pigment on a wet clay surface for ""Archipelago"" (1987), oil and tar for ""August 13, 1961"" (1988) of the ""Berlin Series"", and oil on oxidized copper for the ""Night Train"" (1988) series. During the 1990s, Krausz also experimented with pigments suspended in an egg-based emulsion on various surfaces, and developed a unique ""secco"" technique using a dry surface primed with marble powder and acrylic gels. His ""(No) Man’s Land"" series (2009-2014) included egg tempera on ""secco"" paintings as well as panels painted with oil and tar, similar to ""Paysages"" (1986) or the ""Berlin Series"" (1988). In a recent portrait series, Krausz experimented with drawing in conté on mylar. He also incorporated photography within the installations ""Suite Roumaine"" and ""Traces-mémoire"" (1992) or exhibited photographs as individual works for the ""De Natura (Humana)"" exhibition.          Early in his career, Krausz's work drew attention for its political iconography and illustration of          ""the abuses, subjugation and suffering stemming from totalitarism"". In 1989, at the time of the Robert McLaughlin Gallery exhibition, art historian James D. Campbell wrote that Krausz ""is above all, a humanist and his continuing attempts at commemoration — both vehemently personal and unavoidably universal — have a deeply felt and humanizing focus."" In his review of Krausz's 1991 ""Journeys"" exhibition published in ""Art in America"", Frederick Ted Castle wrote, ""Peter Krausz takes trips that are calculated to remind us that isolation—and brutalization—are human experiences that know no historical period, no geographical area nor cultural configuration, and his souvenirs make effective art."" Since the mid 1990s, Krausz's ""secco"" landscape series has been praised for their subtle, commemorative messaging and meditative, yet disquieting beauty. For ""ARTnews"" reviewer Richard Chang, his work ""offered a serene meditation on nature and of how humans have imprinted it with boundaries."" As a contemporary artist working within a classic medium, curator Jocelyne Fortin of the Musée Régional de Rimouski credits Krausz for ""breathing new life"" into landscape and for shaping ""it into a unique and stunning style."" For her, ""Peter Krausz has invented a highly colourful and emotional wordless language.""          In recognition of his artistic accomplishments, Krausz was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (RCA) in 2011. His work was the subject of several documentaries including Doina Harap's ""Peter Krausz No Mans Land"" (2009) which premiered at the ""Festival international du film sur l'art"" (Montreal). During his career, he was awarded multiple grants from the Canada Council for the Arts and Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec, as well as won four ""integration of art within architecture"" competitions including a mural for the Pointe-à-Callière Museum (Montreal). Krausz has also served on juries for the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts, Canada Council for the Arts, Ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec as well as the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec.          His work is found in the permanent collection of Canada Council for the Arts Art Bank, the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Lethbridge Art Gallery, the Jewish Museum (Manhattan), Arkansas Art Centre, and Artothèque (Montpellier, France). His work is included in the collections of the Department of External Affairs of Canada, the Montreal Arts Council, Musée d’archéologie Pointe-à-Callière, Bibliothèque nationale du Québec, Musée d'art de Joliette, Musée des Beaux-arts de Sherbrooke, and Musée Régional de Rimouski. His work is also found in the corporate collections of Air Canada, Astral Media, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bell Canada, Bombardier, Cirque du Soleil, Citibank, Royal Bank of Canada, Sun Life of Canada, and Teleglobe Canada.","['20th-century Canadian painters', '21st-century Canadian painters', 'Artists from Montreal', '1946 births', 'Living people', 'People from Bra\xc8\x99ov', 'Universit\xc3\xa9 de Montr\xc3\xa9al faculty', 'Romanian emigrants to Canada']"

The type species ""Linhevenator tani"" was named and described in 2011 by Xu Xing, Tan Qingwei, Corwin Sullivan, Han Fenglu and Xiao Dong. The generic name combines a reference to the Linhe region with a Latin ""venator"", ""hunter"". The specific name honours Professor Tan Lin.          The holotype of ""Linhevenator"" is specimen LHV0021, a partial skeleton of an adult individual, including a cranium and mandible, six dorsal vertebrae, a right scapula, a right humerus, the ilia, a left femur and a left foot. It was found in 2009 and represents the most complete troodontid remains known from the Upper Cretaceous. Its four autapomorphies (unique traits) include a jugal with a lateral flange, a surangular crest that is anteroventrally oriented, the presence of medial expansion near the distal end of the femur, and a wide longitudinal groove present along the distal third of the dorsal surface of the third metatarsal.          ""Linhevenator"" is a troodontid, a group of small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. ""Linhevenator"" is a rather large troodontid with an estimated body weight of . The arms are relatively short but the humerus is very robust. The describers suggest the arm might have been used for digging or climbing. The first toe was preserved in a lateral position, instead of pointing forwards. ""Linhevenator"" has a dromaeosaurid-like pedal digit II, carrying a sickle-claw larger than that of basal troodontids.          ""Linhevenator"" was assigned to the Troodontidae by the describers. It possesses a combination of ""primitive"" (basal) and derived characters, but was found to be a derived troodontid in a phylogenetic analysis, in a polytomy with ""Troodon"" and a clade formed by ""Zanabazar"" and ""Saurornithoides"". This position was seen by the authors as an indication for an evolutionary trend in the Troodontidae of shortening the forelimbs and for a parallel evolution of large sickle-claws with both the troodontids and the dromaeosaurids.","['Cretaceous dinosaurs', 'Dinosaurs of Asia', 'Fossil taxa described in 2011', 'Troodontids']"

It can be located with a or larger telescope as an 11th magnitude object about 2.5° east-northeast of the star Zeta Ursae Minoris. The galaxy is inclined by an angle of 33° to the line of sight along a position angle of 162°.          A morphological classification of (R')SB(rs)bc indicates that NGC 6217 has a false outer ring-like structure formed from the spiral arms (R'), a well-defined bar running across the nucleus (SB), a partial inner ring (rs), and moderately-wound spiral arms (bc). The nucleus is spherical in shape, showing no indication of oblateness. The prominent bar spans an angular distance of 48″ (48 arc seconds) across the galaxy along a position angle of 35.97° ± 0.35°. At 10″ southeast of the nucleus is a prominent region of star formation. The inner ring is about 43″.5 across.          NGC 6217 has been characterized as a starburst galaxy, which means it is undergoing a high rate of star formation compared to a typical galaxy. As a result, the spectrum is dominated by stellar photoionization from young, hot stars. This component is less than 10 million years old, producing a blue-hued spectral continuum with absorption weak lines from elements other than hydrogen and helium. At the core of the galaxy is a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus which has formed an H II region.","['Barred spiral galaxies', 'Ursa Minor (constellation)', 'NGC objects', 'UGC objects', 'Arp objects']"

Hosny is also an integral member of the Egypt national football team and was a member of the 2008 African Nations Cup winning team, as well as being chosen as ""Player of the Tournament"".          Hosny started his professional football career at Ismaily in Egypt, and was the youngest player in the Egyptian first division when Ismaily won the League Championship in the season 2001–02. In 2003, Hosni joined the Egyptian U-20's in the FIFA World Youth Championship 2003 in the Arab Emirates. In this tournament he caught the eyes of big clubs in Europe such as Juventus, Trabzonspor, Arsenal, and also smaller sides such as Nantes, and Strasbourg, but his club Ismaily refused to sell the player, since he was considered an integral part of the team.          At the end of 2003, he played in the Arabian Club Championship final but lost, achieving the same result in the 2003 African Champions League. In 2004 Hosny was selected for the first time in his career to play for the Egyptian national team in the 2004 African Cup of Nations in Tunisia and was one of the youngest players in the tournament.          He re-joined Ismaily in January 2011.          In summer 2005, Hosny signed a five-year contract with French club RC Strasbourg, for whom he appeared in 22 Ligue 1 matches. He was called up for the Egyptian national team that would participate in the 2006 African Cup of Nations in Egypt, but was injured just one week before the tournament started and could not play. The Egyptian national team eventually went on to win the tournament against Côte d'Ivoire.          In the 2005–06 season, Strasbourg was relegated to Ligue 2. Hosny then left the team on a season loan deal, returning to his original club Ismaily.

After the loan spell ended, and since Strasbourg failed to promote to Ligue 1, Hosny agreed to extend his stay at Ismaily on a permanent deal. However, this move did not receive consent from the French club, and they decided to sue the player for signing a contract with another club without their consent.          On 29 July 2008, and in an unexpected move, it was announced that Hosny had signed a loan deal for two seasons for Emirate club Al-Ahli of Dubai, despite the player having been linked with offers from top European clubs in England and Spain. Ismaily club later announced that the only official offer they received, other than Ahli Dubai's offer, was from Spanish club Osasuna.

113028,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113028,Inuyasha,", also known as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. It premiered in ""Weekly Shōnen Sunday"" on November 13, 1996 and concluded on June 18, 2008, with the chapters collected into 56 ""tankōbon"" volumes by Shogakukan.          The series follows Kagome Higurashi, a 15-year-old girl from Tokyo who is transported to the Sengoku period after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half-demon Inuyasha. When a monster from that era tries to take the magical Shikon Jewel embodied in Kagome, she accidentally shatters the Jewel into many pieces that are dispersed across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome start traveling to recover it before the powerful demon Naraku finds all the shards. Inuyasha and Kagome gain several allies during their journey, including Shippo, Miroku, Sango and Kirara. In contrast to the typically comedic nature of much of Takahashi's previous work, ""Inuyasha"" deals with darker subject matter, using the setting of the Sengoku period to easily display the violent content.          It was adapted into two anime television series produced by Sunrise. The first was broadcast for 167 episodes on Yomiuri TV in Japan from October 16, 2000 until September 13, 2004. The second series, called ""Inuyasha: The Final Act"", began airing five years later on October 3, 2009 to cover the rest of the manga series and ended on March 29, 2010 after 26 episodes. Four feature films and an original video animation have also been released. Other merchandise include video games and a light novel. Viz Media licensed the manga, the two anime series, and movies for North America.          In modern-day Tokyo, Kagome Higurashi lives on the grounds of her family's Shinto shrine with her mother, grandfather and little brother. On her fifteenth birthday, when she goes to retrieve her cat, a centipede demon bursts out of the enshrined and drags Kagome into it. But instead of hitting the bottom of the well, Kagome time travels to the past during Japan's Sengoku period. The centipede demon seeks the , an artifact that would grant any wish the bearer desires; it had previously been defeated by a warrior priestess named Kikyo, and Kagome looks just like her. In fact, Kagome is a descendant of Kikyo and houses the Shikon Jewel in her own body. Kagome finds a young man pinned by a sacred arrow on a tree and, in a moment of desperation, frees him to defeat the centipede demon. The man is Inuyasha, a half-dog demon who was pinned by Kikyo for trying to steal the jewel. However, the Shikon Jewel is extracted from Kagome's body, and in the ensuing fight with another crow demon, the jewel is shattered into numerous shards that disperse across ancient Japan, falling into the hands of those who gain the individual shards' power.          After Inuyasha gains his father's sword Tessaiga and is subdued by a magical necklace to keep him in line, he aids Kagome in collecting the shards and dealing with the threats they cause. The two are joined in their quest by the young fox demon Shippo while dealing with third parties groups like Inuyasha's older brother Sesshomaru and the partially revived Kikyo, whose own version of what happened years ago brings the events into question. When joined by Miroku, a perverted monk whose bloodline is cursed, Inuyasha and Kagome learn the truth: that the initial conflict between Inuyasha and Kikyo, revealed to originally be lovers, was caused by a devious half-demon named Naraku. The evolving Naraku is revealed to have been born from the soul of an evil man named Onigumo inhabiting a body created by countless demons as part of a pact and who also placed the curse on Miroku's family. Naraku is after the Shikon Jewel shards for his own ends. Inuyasha's group is soon joined after by Sango, a demon slayer whose clan was killed when her younger brother Kohaku fell under Naraku's control. Over time, Inuyasha enhances Tessaiga powers as he contends with Naraku's minion incarnations like Kagura and the reanimated Band of Seven. Inuyasha's team is loosely allied by Sesshomaru, Kikyo, and a wolf demon named Koga, who wants to avenge his comrades while flirting with Kagome.          While Naraku momentarily removes his heart in the form of the Infant, who later attempts to overthrow Naraku through his vessel Moryomaru, Kohaku regains his freewill and memories, as he attempts to help out of guilt for indirectly killing his father. During that time, Sesshomaru settles things with Inuyasha to enable his brother to perfect Tessaiga to its optimal abilities. Eventually, Koga is forced to stand on the sidelines, Kikyo posthumously uses the last of her power to give Kohaku a second chance at life, and Naraku finally reassembles the Shikon Jewel. Although Inuyasha and his allies defeat him, realizing his true desire is for Kikyo's love despite his hatred towards her and that it can never be granted, Naraku uses his wish to trap himself and Kagome in the Shikon Jewel. The jewel intends to have Kagome make a selfish wish so she and Naraku will be trapped in conflict for eternity. But with Inuyasha by her side, Kagome wishes for the Shikon Jewel to disappear. The action, though, causes Kagome to return to her time with the Well sealed, causing her and Inuyasha to lose contact for three years.          In that time, the Sengoku period changes drastically: Sango and Miroku have three children together; Kohaku resumes his journey to become a strong demon slayer with Kirara as his companion; and Shippo attains the seventh rank as a fox demon. Back in the present, Kagome graduates from high school before finally managing to get the Bone Eater's Well in her backyard to work again. Kagome returns to the Sengoku period, where she stays with Inuyasha and becomes his wife.          Rumiko Takahashi wrote ""Inuyasha"" after finishing ""Ranma ½"". In contrast to her previous works, Takahashi wanted to do a darker storyline distant from her comedy series. In order to portray violent themes softly, the story was set in the Sengoku Era, when wars were common. For the designs of samurai or castles, no notable research was made by the author who considered such topics common knowledge. By June 2001, a clear ending to the series was not established as Takahashi still was not sure about how to end the relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome. Furthermore, Takahashi stated that she did not have an ending to previous manga she wrote during the beginning, having figured them out as their serialization progressed.          Written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, ""Inuyasha"" premiered in Japan in the November 13, 1996 issue of ""Weekly Shōnen Sunday"", where it ran until its conclusion in the June 18, 2008 issue. The chapters were collected into 56 ""tankōbon"" volumes published by Shogakukan, with the first volume released in May 1997 and the last released in February 2009. In 2013, a special ""Epilogue"" chapter was published in ""Weekly Shōnen Sunday"" as part of the ""Heroes Come Back"" anthology composed of short stories by manga artists to raise funds for recovery of the areas afflicted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.          Viz Media licensed the series for an English translated release in North America. Initially, Viz released it in monthly American comic book format, each issue containing two or three chapters from the original manga, but eventually abandoned this system in favor of trade paperbacks with the same chapter divisions as the Japanese volumes. Viz released its first trade paperback volume in March 1998. At the time, American manga reprints were normally ""flipped"" to conform to the American convention of reading books from left to right by mirroring the original artwork; among other effects, this caused right-handed characters to appear left-handed. Viz later stopped flipping its new manga releases, although ""Inuyasha"" was already well into printing by the time this change was made with volume 38. As of January 11, 2011, all 56 volumes have been released in North America. From November 2009 to February 2014, Viz reprinted the series in their ""VizBig"" format, combining three of the original volumes into a single omnibus with slightly larger pages and full-color bonus art that was previously reduced to grayscale, and in the original right to left format. Viz Media also issues a separate series of ani-manga volumes which are derived from full-color screenshots of the anime episodes. These volumes are slightly smaller than the regular manga volumes, are oriented in the Japanese tradition of right to left, feature new covers with higher quality pages, and a higher price point versus the regular volumes. Each ani-manga volume is arranged into chapters that correspond to the anime episodes rather than the manga.          The first ""Inuyasha"" anime adaptation produced by Sunrise premiered in Japan on Animax on October 16, 2000 and ran for 167 episodes till its conclusion on September 13, 2004.

At 0000 UTC on January 13, an extratropical cyclone formed northeast of Taiwan, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to issue storm warnings on that developing low; 18 hours later, the storm southeast of Kyushu absorbed a tropical depression which formed near the Philippines. Fed by the remnants of the tropical depression’s huge amounts of heat and vapor, the storm quickly intensified and became a hurricane-force bomb cyclone when it passed over the sea south of Japan on January 14. Late the same day, the estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds reached when the storm was east of the Tōhoku region.

He served as the 21st head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA, taking over the position mid-season on December 13, 2008 after then-head coach Maurice Cheeks was fired after starting the season with a 9–14 record. The team went 32–27 under DiLeo's leadership (finishing the season 41-41 overall), and lost their Eastern Conference quarterfinals series to the Orlando Magic. At the end of the season, DiLeo withdrew his name from consideration to return as head coach, opting instead to return to the Sixers' front office as senior vice president and assistant general manager. He was promoted to general manager in 2012, but was subsequently removed at the end of the season.          DiLeo was a basketball star at Cinnaminson High School in Cinnaminson Township, New Jersey.          DiLeo played basketball at Tennessee Tech and La Salle University, where, as a junior, he was named first-team Academic All-American and went on to graduate maxima cum laude from the La Salle School of Business.

27123,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27123,Saarland,"The Saarland (German: ""das Saarland"" – ; - ) is one of the sixteen federal states (or ""Bundesländer"") of Germany. With its capital at Saarbrücken, it has an area of 2,570 km² and its population (as of 30 April 2012) is approximately 1,012,000. In terms of both area and population size – apart from the city-states of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg – it is Germany's smallest federal state. The wealth of its coal deposits and their large-scale industrial exploitation, coupled with its location on the border between France and Germany, have given the Saarland a unique history in modern times.          Prior to its creation as the Territory of the Saar Basin by the League of Nations after World War I, the Saarland (or simply ""the Saar"", as it is frequently referred to) did not exist as a unified entity. Until then, some parts of it had been Prussian while others belonged to Bavaria. The inhabitants voted to rejoin Germany in a referendum held in 1935.          From 1947 to 1956 the Saarland was a French-occupied territory (the ""Saar Protectorate"") separate from the rest of Germany. Between 1950 and 1956, Saarland was a member of the Council of Europe. In 1955, in another referendum, the inhabitants were offered independence, but voted instead for the territory to become a state of West Germany.          From 1920 to 1935, and again from 1947 to 1959, the inhabitants of the Saarland used money (Saar franc) and postage stamps issued specially for the territory.          Saarland is the result of a regulation of the treaty of Versailles and was created in 1919. Prior to this creation, there never existed a comparable administrative unit or a feeling of togetherness.          The region of the Saarland was settled by the Celtic tribes of Treveri and Mediomatrici. The most impressive relic of their time is the remains of a fortress of refuge at Otzenhausen in the north of the Saarland. In the 1st century BC, the Roman Empire made the region part of its province of Belgica. The Celtic population mixed with the Roman immigrants. The region gained wealth, which can still be seen in the remains of Roman villas and villages.          Roman rule ended in the 5th century, when the Franks conquered the territory. For the next 1,300 years the region shared the history of the Kingdom of the Franks, the Carolingian Empire and of the Holy Roman Empire. The region of the Saarland was divided into several small territories, some of which were ruled by sovereigns of adjoining regions. Most important of the local rulers were the counts of Nassau-Saarbrücken. Within the Holy Roman Empire these territories gained a wide range of independence, threatened, however, by the French kings, who sought, from the 17th century onwards, to incorporate all the territories on the western side of the river Rhine and repeatedly invaded the area in 1635, in 1676, in 1679 and in 1734, extending their realm to the Saar River and establishing the city and stronghold of Saarlouis in 1680.          It was not the king of France but the armies of the French Revolution who terminated the independence of the states in the region of the Saarland. After 1792 they conquered the region and made it part of the French Republic. While a strip in the west belonged to the Département Moselle, the centre in 1798 became part of the Département de Sarre, and the east became part of the Département du Mont-Tonnerre. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the region was divided again. Most of it became part of the Prussian Rhine Province. Another part in the east, corresponding to the present Saarpfalz district, was allocated to the Kingdom of Bavaria. A small part in the northeast was ruled by the Duke of Oldenburg.          On 31 July 1870, the French Emperor Napoleon III ordered an invasion across the River Saar to seize Saarbrücken. The first shots of the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71 were fired on the heights of Spichern, south of Saarbrücken. The Saar region became part of the German Empire which came into existence on 18 January 1871, during the course of this war.          In 1920 the Saargebiet was occupied by Britain and France under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The occupied area included portions of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate. In practice the region was administered by France. In 1920 this was formalized by a 15-year League of Nations mandate.          In 1933, a considerable number of communists and other political opponents of National Socialism fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany that remained outside national administration following the First World War. As a result, anti-Nazi groups agitated for the Saarland to remain under French administration. However, with most of the population being ethnically German, such views were considered suspect or even treasonable, and therefore found little support.          When the original 15-year term was over, a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935: 90.8% of those voting favored rejoining Germany.          Following the referendum Josef Bürckel was appointed on 1 March 1935 as the German Reich's commissioner for reintegration (""Reichskommissar für die Rückgliederung des Saarlandes""). When the reincorporation was considered accomplished, his title was changed (after 17 June 1936) to ""Reichskommissar für das Saarland"". In September 1939, in response to the German Invasion of Poland, French forces invaded the Saarland in a half-hearted offensive, occupying some villages and meeting little resistance, before withdrawing. A further change was made after 8 April 1940 to ""Reichskommissar für die Saarpfalz""; finally, after 11 March 1941, he was made ""Reichsstatthalter in der ""Westmark"""" (the region's new name, meaning ""Western March or Border""). He died on 28 September 1944 and was succeeded by Willi Stöhr, who remained in office until the region fell to advancing American forces in March 1945.          After World War II, the Saarland came under French occupation and administration again, as the Saar Protectorate.          Under the Monnet Plan France attempted to gain economic control of the German industrial areas with large coal and mineral deposits that were not in Soviet hands: the Ruhr and the Saar area. Attempts to gain control of or internationalize permanently the Ruhr area (see International Authority for the Ruhr) were abandoned in 1951 with the German agreement to pool its coal and steel resources (see European Coal and Steel Community) in return for full political control of the Ruhr. The French attempt to gain economic control over the Saar was more successful at the time, with the final vestiges of French economic influence not ending until 1981. France did not annex the Saar or expel the local German population, as opposed to fate of Upper Silesia which was annexed by Poland in 1949 in accordance with the peace treaty between Poland and the GDR/East Germany (see also Allied-occupied Germany).          In his speech ""Restatement of Policy on Germany"", made in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946, United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes stated the U.S. motive in detaching the Saar from Germany: ""The United States does not feel that it can deny to France, which has been invaded three times by Germany in 70 years, its claim to the Saar territory"". (See also Morgenthau plan for U.S. and UK designs for the Saar.)          From 1945 to 1951, a policy of industrial disarmament was pursued in Germany by the Allies (see the industrial plans for Germany). As part of this policy, limits were placed on production levels, and industries in the Saar were dismantled just as in the Ruhr, although mostly in the period prior to its detachment (see also the 1949 letter from the UK Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin to the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, urging a reconsideration of the dismantling policy).          In 1948, the French government established the Saarland University under the auspices of the University of Nancy. It is the principal university in the ""Bundesland"", the other being HTW.          The Saar Protectorate was headed by a military governor from 30 August 1945: Gilbert Yves Édmond Grandval (b. 1904 – d. 1981), who remained, on 1 January 1948, as High Commissioner, and January 1952 – June 1955 as the first of two French ambassadors, his successor being Eric de Carbonnel (b. 1910 – d. 1965) until 1956.          Saarland, however, was allowed a regional administration very early, consecutively headed by:          In 1954, France and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) developed a detailed plan called the ""Saarstatut"" to establish an independent Saarland. It was signed as an agreement between the two countries on 23 October 1954 as one of the Paris Pacts, but a plebiscite held on 23 October 1955 rejected it by 67.7%.          On 27 October 1956, the Saar Treaty declared that Saarland should be allowed to join the Federal Republic of Germany, which it did on 1 January 1957. This was the last significant international border change in Europe until the fall of Communism.          The Saarland's reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany was sometimes referred to as the """" (""little reunification"", in contrast with the post-Cold War absorption of the GDR). Even after reunification, the Saar franc remained as the territory's currency until West Germany's Deutsche Mark replaced it on 7 July 1959. The Saar Treaty established that French, not English as in the rest of West Germany, should remain the first foreign language taught in Saarland schools; this provision was still largely followed after it was no longer binding.          Since 1971, Saarland has been a member of SaarLorLux, a euroregion created from Saarland, Lorraine, Luxembourg, Rhineland Palatinate, and Wallonia.          The state borders France (""département"" of Moselle, which forms part of the ""région"" of Lorraine) to the south and west, Luxembourg to the west and Rheinland-Pfalz to the north and the east.          It is named after the Saar River, a tributary of the Moselle River (itself a tributary of the Rhine), which runs through the state from the south to the northwest. One third of the land area of the Saarland is covered by forest, one of the highest percentages in Germany. The state is generally hilly; the highest mountain is the Dollberg with a height of 695.4 m (2281 feet).          Most inhabitants live in a city agglomeration on the French border, surrounding the capital of Saarbrücken.          See also List of places in Saarland.          Saarland is divided into six districts (""Landkreise"" in German):          The adherents of the Catholic Church comprise 65.1% of the population, organised in the two dioceses of Trier (comprising the formerly Prussian part of Saarland) and Speyer (for the smaller eastern formerly Palatine part). 19.6% of the Saarlandic population adhere to the Evangelical Church in Germany, organised in the two Landeskirchen named Evangelical Church in the Rhineland and Evangelical Church of the Palatinate, both following the same former territorial partition. 15.4% are not affiliated with one of these churches.          Saarland has the highest concentration of Roman Catholics of any German state, and is one of two states (the other being Bavaria) in which Catholics form an absolute majority (over 50%).          Except for the period between 1985 and 1999 – when the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) held a majority of seats in the Landtag (state diet) – the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has governed the Saarland, either alone or in coalition, continuously since the accession of the state to the Federal of Republic of Germany in 1955.          After the most recent state elections – held in 2012 following the collapse of the ""Jamaica coalition"" agreement of 2009 between the CDU, the liberal FDP, and the centre-left Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (The Greens) – the CDU and SPD, as the two largest parties in the Landtag, decided upon the formation of a ""grand coalition"" under the overall leadership of the current minister-president, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU).          Important income sources are automobile industry, steel industry, ceramic industry and computer science and information systems industry. In the past, coal mining was an important branch of industry.          Saarland is home to the Saarland University.          People in the Saarland speak Rhine Franconian (in the southeast, very similar to that dialect spoken in the western part of the Palatinate) and Moselle Franconian (in the northwest, very similar to that dialect spoken along the Moselle River and the cities of Trier or even in Luxembourg). Outside of the Saarland, specifically the Rhine-Franconian variant spoken in the Landeshauptstadt Saarbrücken is generally considered to be ""the"" Saarland dialect. The two dialect regions are mainly separated by the ""das/ dat"" isogloss; in the northwestern portion of the state, including cities such as Saarlouis, standard German ""das"" is pronounced with a final [t] instead of an [s].          In general, both dialects are an integral part of the “Saarlandish” identity and thus a strong source of local patriotism.          Both dialects, even more so in their respective Saarland flavour, share many characteristic features, some of which will be explained below.          Women and girls are often referred to using the neuter grammatical gender, ""es"", with the pronunciation being something like ""Ähs"". Ähs hat mir's gesaat"" (it told me so"", instead of she told me so""; vs. High German: Sie hat es mir gesagt""). This stems from the word ""Mädchen"" (girl) being neuter in German (""es"" is correct in German when referring to words like ""Mädchen"" but would not be used by itself in reference to a woman).          The conjunctive in Rhine Franconian is normally composed with the words ""dääd"" (High German “tät” = “would do”) or ""gäng"" (“would go”) as auxiliary verbs: ""Isch dääd saan, dass..."" (“I would say that...”) instead of the High German ""Ich würde sagen, dass..."".          Declension is rather different:          Diphthongs are less common. This is because the Standard German diphthongs ""ei"" and ""au"" are each the result of a merger of two Middle High German vowels - however, these mergers did not take place in the Saarland, and only one of the two merged vowels is pronounced as a diphthong. The front rounded vowels ""ö"", ""ü"", and ""eu"" are replaced by ""e"", ""i"", and ""ei"" respectively.          Both the Rhein-Franconian and Mosel-Franconian dialects (and Luxemburgish) have merged the palatal fricative ""ich"" sound with the post-alveolar fricative (the sound in ""Schule"" 'school') causing minimal pairs such as ""Kirche"" 'church' and ""Kirsche"" 'cherry' to be pronounced in the same way.          French has had a considerable influence on the vocabulary, although the pronunciation of imported French words usually is quite different from their original. Popular examples comprise ""Trottwaa"" (from ""trottoir""), ""Fissääl"" (from ""ficelle""), and the imperative or greeting ""aalleh!"" (from ""allez!"").          The English phrase ""My house is green"" is pronounced almost the same (in the Rhine Franconian variant): ""Mei Haus is grien"". The main difference lies in the pronunciation of the ""r"" sound.          Regional beer brewer Karlsberg has taken advantage of the Saarlandish dialect to create clever advertising for its staple product, UrPils. Examples include a trio of men enjoying a beer, flanked by baby carriages, the slogan reading ""Mutter schafft"" (meaning ""Mom's at work"" in Saarlandish, but plays on the High German word ""Mutterschaft"", or ""motherhood""); another depicts a trio of men at a bar, with one realizing his beer has been drunk by one of the others, the slogan reading ""Kenner war's"" (meaning ""It was no one"" [""Keiner war es""] in Saarlandish, but playing on the High German word ""Kenner"", or ""connoisseur"", translating to ""It was a connoisseur""); a third shows an empty beer crate in the middle of outer space, the text reading ""All"" (meaning ""empty"" in Saarlandish, but playing on the same High German word meaning ""outer space"").          The French language has a special standing in Saarland due to the fact that France sought to incorporate the region into the French state shortly after World War II and subsequently pressed the Federal German government to promote French as a second language in schools (ahead of English or any other foreign language education in the state). Today, a large part of the population is able to speak French, and it is compulsory at many schools. Saarbrücken is also home to a bilingual ""Deutsch-Französisches Gymnasium"" (German-French high school). In January 2014 the Saarland state government announced its aim of making the region fully bilingual in German and French by 2043.          The Saar competed in the qualifying section of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but failed after coming second to West Germany but ahead of Norway. It also competed as Saar in the 1952 Summer Olympics and the field handball world championships in the beginning of the 1950s.","['Saarland', 'NUTS 1 statistical regions of the European Union', 'States and territories established in 1957', '1957 establishments in West Germany']"

The population was 16,180 at the 2010 census, up from 13,864 at the 2000 census.          The town’s original name was Coburn Station, commemorating a saloon keeper. It was renamed Truckee after a Paiute chief, whose assumed Paiute name was Tru-ki-zo. He was the father of Chief Winnemucca and grandfather of Sarah Winnemucca. The first Europeans who came to cross the Sierra Nevada encountered his tribe. The friendly Chief rode toward them yelling, “Tro-kay!”, which is Paiute for “Everything is all right”. The unaware travelers assumed he was yelling his name. Chief Truckee later served as a guide for John C. Frémont.          Truckee is located along Interstate 80 at (39.342163, -120.203568).          According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (3.96%) is water, mostly the Truckee River, the only outlet of Lake Tahoe.          Truckee has a dry-summer continental climate (Köppen ""Dsb""). Winters are extremely snowy and cold if not severe, while summers are cool-to-warm and dry, with occasional periods of intense thunderstorms.

Recent land clearing outside town limits may affect the population.          Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Truckee. The city's passenger rail station is located at 10065 Donner Pass Road in the historic downtown. Amtrak Train 5, the westbound California Zephyr, departs Truckee daily with service to Colfax, Roseville, Sacramento, Davis, Martinez, and Emeryville across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Train 6, the eastbound California Zephyr, departs Truckee daily with service to Reno, Sparks, Winnemucca, Elko, Salt Lake City, Provo, Helper, Green River, Grand Junction, Glenwood Springs, Denver, Omaha, Galesburg, and Chicago. Capitol Corridor service from San Jose has been proposed, with the intention to go to Reno, Nevada. It is uncertain whether that extension may ever happen because there is only a single-track tunnel through the crest of the Sierra Nevada mountains at Norden, California. Traffic is heavy, often with trains waiting on either side to cross through, and therefore the Union Pacific railroad has said in the past it is unlikely that Amtrak passenger rail travel will increase in frequency (unless a second tunnel is built).          There is a free public bus, operated by neighboring Placer County, California; this connects the Truckee train station to the West Shore of Lake Tahoe, and a second goes to Incline Village, Nevada. There are also winter ski buses between Reno Airport and the ski areas near Truckee. Greyhound operates from the Amtrak rail station, going west to Sacramento and San Francisco, and east to Reno, Salt Lake City and Denver. There are also private bus companies from the San Francisco Bay Area which bring skiers up to Truckee for day trips.          Interstate 80 passes just to the north of central Truckee. Essentially, it follows the old emigrant wagon route. Reno is to the east on I-80. State Route 89, a north-south highway, connects Truckee to the West Shore of Lake Tahoe.          The Truckee-Tahoe Airport provides access to the North Lake Tahoe recreational area through general aviation services. The airfield boasts a 7000-foot main runway and a 4600-foot crosswind runway. The airport is not serviced by any commercial airline at the present time. There are also glider tours operated from the airport.          The town is governed by a five-member Town Council, which elects one of its members as Mayor; the mayor presides over meetings and ceremonial events, but has no other special responsibilities. The mayor as of February 2015 is Alicia Barr.          In the California State Legislature, Truckee is in , and .          In the United States House of Representatives, Truckee is in .          There are no four-year universities in Truckee. The closest large universities are in Reno, Nevada and Sacramento, California. The two-year Sierra College, headquartered in Rocklin, has its Tahoe-Truckee campus in town. Students can complete all the requirements for a two-year Associate of Arts degree at this campus, as well as various certificates, such as Accounting.          The Tahoe-Truckee Unified School District provides K-12 education to Truckee and the Lake Tahoe area with nine traditional schools, of which two elementary schools, a middle school, elementary school and Truckee High School are in the town itself. A newer middle school was recently built as well.          In interscholastic athletics, due to Truckee's isolation from the rest of California by the Sierra Nevada crest, Truckee High competes in the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association along with four other similarly-isolated Northern California schools including North Tahoe High School, South Tahoe High School, Coleville High School, and Needles High School.          The Truckee River flows from Lake Tahoe for approximately 100 miles northeast to the border of the arid Great Basin of Nevada and Utah and into Pyramid Lake. This water source formed a natural, seasonal route for Native Americans. Although no particular tribe is considered to have inhabited Truckee year-round, the Washoe Tribe occupied a large territory roughly centered in the modern day Carson City area, but Shoshone and Paiute Tribes were also present (the Paiute Tribe Reservation now encompasses Pyramid Lake). These peoples are considered to be the primary source of Native American travelers in the area. Hobart Mills, just north of Truckee on Highway 89, has a large, horizontal, circular petroglyph of the type common to travel routes in Nevada. The date of that petroglyph, as well as several etched into granite slabs on the summit west of Truckee, are not agreed upon. But those artifacts, as well as the abundance of arrowheads throughout the Truckee region, attest to a minimum of hundreds of years of Native American presence. It is possible that, like the Shoshone, Ute and earlier Fremont tribes of Utah and Eastern Nevada, the nearby Native American populations fluctuated over the course of millennia as a result of weather cycles, food changes, and possibly disease or war. Some historians date the pre-Fremont Indian culture of Eastern Nevada to as early as 10,000 B.C. and it's likely that the Eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains next to Truckee, since it faces the Great Basin, had Native Americans of a hunter-gatherer culture visit at least as early as 3,000 B.C. These people were probably of a purely nomadic group since datable housing structures like those found in Nevada and Utah are not present. Like most of the modern history of the West, as the European settlers' population increased, the Native American population decreased. The Gold Rush of 1849 caused a surge in fortune-seeking settlers (although Truckee itself wasn't settled until later). It is not known exactly when the last Native Americans passed naturally through Truckee, but they were visually recorded in the 1850s.          The Donner Party ordeal is arguably Truckee's most famous historical event. In 1846, a group of settlers from Illinois, originally known as the Donner-Reed Party but now usually referred to as the Donner Party, became snowbound in early fall as a result of several trail mishaps, poor decision-making, and an early onset of winter that year. Choosing multiple times to take shortcuts to save distance compared to the traditional Oregon Trail, coupled with infighting, a disastrous crossing of the Utah salt flats, and the attempt to use the pass near the Truckee River (now Donner Pass) all caused delays in their journey.          Finally, a large, early blizzard brought the remaining settlers to a halt at the edge of what is now Donner Lake, about below the steep granite summit of the Sierra Nevada mountains and east of their final destination, Sutter's Fort (near Sacramento). Several attempts at carting their few remaining wagons, oxen, and supplies over the summit—sometimes by pulling them up by rope—proved impossible due to freezing conditions and a lack of any preexisting trail. The party returned, broken in spirit and short of supplies, to the edge of Donner Lake. A portion of the camp members also returned to the Alder Creek campsite a few miles to the east.          During the hard winter the travelers endured starvation and were later found to have practiced cannibalism. Fifteen members constructed makeshift snowshoes and set out for Sutter's Fort in the late fall but were thwarted by freezing weather and disorientation. Only seven survived: two were lost, and six died. Those who died were used as food by those who remained. The Truckee camp survivors were saved by a Reed Party member who had set out ahead after having been ejected from the party months earlier, for killing another man in a violent argument. Seeing that his group never arrived at Sutter's Fort, he initiated several relief parties.          Of the original 87 settlers in the Donner-Reed party, 48 survived the ordeal. The Donner Memorial State Park is dedicated to the settlers and is located at the East End of Donner Lake.          Truckee grew as a railroad town originally named Coburn Station, starting with the Transcontinental Railroad. The railroad goes into downtown Truckee, and the Amtrak passenger lines still stop there on the trip from Chicago to San Francisco.          In 1886, the Chinese inhabitants, about 1,400 in number, were expelled from Truckee as part of a campaign that included a boycott of any business that did business with Chinese.          In 1891, Truckee's famous lawman, Jacob Teeter, was killed in a violent gunfight with fellow lawman, James Reed (no relation to James Frazier Reed of the Donner-Reed Party).          Truckee reportedly had one of the nation's first mechanized ski lifts at the site of the Hilltop Lodge. The historic Hilltop Lodge was converted to a restaurant in the 1940s by the Crandall Brothers, and eventually became Cottonwood Restaurant and Bar. There were possibly two rope tows and a Poma lift, which was installed in 1954. At the same location, there was a ski jump constructed during the early 1900s that was designed by Lars Haugen, a seven time Olympic ski jumping champion.          The Charlie Chaplin comedy ""The Gold Rush"" (1925) was filmed entirely in Truckee.          Truckee features in season 5 (2015-2016) of TV show ""Hell on Wheels.""","['Truckee, California', 'Cities in Nevada County, California', 'Populated places in the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)', 'Incorporated cities and towns in California', 'Populated places established in 1993', '1993 establishments in California', 'Sacramento metropolitan area']"

24735930,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24735930,Adam Collin,"Adam James Collin (born 9 December 1984) is an English goalkeeper.          Born in Penrith, Cumbria, Collin started his career as professional footballer with Newcastle United as a youngster. He did not feature in the Newcastle first team, but was named as a substitute on a number of occasions. He then had spells on loan at Doncaster Rovers and Oldham Athletic before being released by Newcastle in the summer of 2004.          Workington assistant manager Tony Elliott, a former goalkeeper but at the time not attached to the club recommended him to Workington manager Tommy Cassidy. Collin was added to the Reds squad just before the start of the 2004–05 season as cover for Neil Thompson. As Thompson was suspended for the first match of the new season, Collin made his debut in Reds 4–0 home win over Matlock Town. Collin kept clean sheets in each of his first four matches to establish himself as first choice goalkeeper.          He was sent off in 1–0 away defeat at Hyde United in April 2005, for handball outside the penalty area. His suspension was overturned after a video proved he was inside the area, he was the first Workington player to have a suspension quashed in such a manner. Collin saved three penalties in a shoot-out against Farsley Celtic on 17 May 2005, Workington won 6–5 to win promotion to the Conference North.          Adam made 41 starts during the 2005–06 season and a further 42 during the 2006–07 season.          Collin started to train with Carlisle United twice a week in December 2008, and did enough to secure the offer of a permanent contract in February 2009, joining the club at the end of the 2008–09 season.          Collin made his debut for Carlisle United in the 2009–10 Football League Trophy Northern Section First Round, in the 2–2 draw with Morecambe on 1 September 2009. Carlisle won after a penalty shoot-out. He played again, in the Northern Section Second Round of the same tournament on 6 October, in Carlisle's 4–2 home victory over Macclesfield Town.          Collin then went on to be selected in Carlisle's first team on a regular basis, and saved the penalty that took the Cumbrians to Wembley for the final of the 2010 Football League Trophy.          Adam Collin's run of 146 consecutive starts ended when he was displaced in favour of Mark Gillespie in Carlisle's Football League Cup tie against Preston North End on 4 September 2012. He regained his place in the starting line-up in November 2012, missing 13 first team games in two months. Subsequently, Adam lost his starting place due to Carlisle's policy of goalkeeper rotation and was released in May 2013.          On 23 May 2013, Collin agreed to sign for fellow League One side Rotherham United, in preference to pursuing interest from Scottish Premier League and English Championship clubs.          On the 25 May 2014, Collin gained promotion to the English Football League Championship with Rotherham United, after a heroic display in the Play-Off Final at Wembley. After trailing Leyton Orient by two goals to nil, Rotherham United fought back to level, before Collin saved two penalties - to maintain his 100% record over seven penalty shoot-outs, saving at least two penalties during each shoot-out.          Collin has been ever present in the starting line up at Rotherham United since taking over as preferred goalkeeper from Scott Shearer.          Throughout the start of the 2014–15 season, Collin was a pivotal member of the Rotherham side that maintained unlikely survival in the Championship, despite a late 3 point deduction, and a sizeable gulf in the budgets available at Rotherham and their fellow competitors. Collin was the main starter for Steve Evans as he picked him over Scott Loach and loan signing Emiliano Martinez of Arsenal and despite some dip in form towards the latter stages of the season, being replaced by Martinez in particular, played 36 times in the league and once in the FA Cup and was even named in an article in The Guardian as one of the Football League Championship's six most influential players.          At the start of the 2015–16 season, Collin was relegated to second choice keeper, with first Kelle Roos and later Lee Camp being chosen ahead of him. He made just two first team appearances, and on 15 January 2016 he was allowed to join Aberdeen on loan for the remainder of the season. He played three times for Aberdeen before returning to Rotherham.          On 15 June 2016, Collin signed for Notts County.

8438322,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8438322,Anthony le Flamenc,"Anthony le Flamenc (, , , ; ) was an early 14th-century Frankish knight and lord of Karditsa (now Akraifnio) in the region of Boeotia, in the Duchy of Athens.          Anthony le Flamenc was of Flemish ancestry (as his surname indicates), and his forefathers had long been settled in the Holy Land before he rose to prominence in Frankish Greece. The eminent 19th-century scholar of the Frankish rule in Greece, Karl Hopf, suggested that he was the husband and co-ruler of Isabella Pallavicini, lady of the March of Bodonitsa until her death in 1286, after which he disputed the succession to the march with her cousin Thomas Pallavicini. However, as William Miller pointed out, this was pure conjecture lacking any basis in contemporary sources.          Le Flamenc is mentioned for the first time in 1303, when the French version of the ""Chronicle of the Morea"" records that the Duke of Athens Guy II de la Roche appointed him as his deputy (""bailli"") over Thessaly, a territory which had come under Guy's protection after its Greek ruler, Guy's uncle Constantine Doukas, died and left his underage son John II Doukas under Guy's tutelage. Anthony's son John, also received a post in Thessaly. Miller comments that it was possibly their experience with the Vlachs of the region that recommended them for such an important assignment. Anthony is also known to have had estates at nearby Koroneia and Patricio, possibly to be identified with the modern village of Ypsilantis, where a medieval tower is located.          Anthony was apparently held in high esteem: the ""Chronicle of the Morea"" calls him not only ""the wisest of the duchy"", but ""one of the wisest men in Romania [Latin Greece]"". Indeed, he is the sole member of the lower nobility of the Duchy of Athens to be mentioned in the sources.          He was a loyal follower of Matilda of Hainaut, the wife of Guy II. In 1305 he was among the witnesses to a deed relating to her property in the Low Countries (from which both of them hailed) and he was present with his son at her second engagement with Charles of Taranto in Thebes on 2 April 1309. In 1308, the Republic of Venice accused Anthony, Guy, Rocaforte, and Boniface of Verona of plotting to seize the Venetian colony of Negroponte.           On 15 March 1311, Anthony fought in the Battle of Halmyros against the Catalan Company and was one of the few survivors, though he was captured and held for ransom, as implied by the presence of his name in a list of correspondents of the Venetian authorities in 1313. Anthony built the Church of Saint George at Karditsa soon after his return from captivity, as attested by a donor's inscription, probably, as Miller suggests, commissioned by Anthony in fulfilment of a vow taken before the battle.","['13th-century births', '14th-century deaths', 'Christians of the Crusades', 'Medieval Thessaly', 'Medieval Boeotia', 'People of the Duchy of Athens', 'Flemish people', 'Lords of the Crusader states']"

60967,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60967,Ortolan bunting,"The ortolan, or ortolan bunting (""Emberiza hortulana"") is a bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a passerine family now separated by most modern scholars from the finches, Fringillidae. The name ""ortolan"" is French, from the Latin ""hortulanus"", the gardener bird, (from ""hortus"", a garden).          In September 2007, the French government announced its intent to enforce long ignored laws protecting the bird.          The ortolan is 16 cm in length and weighs . In appearance and habits it much resembles its congener the yellowhammer, but lacks the bright colouring of that species; the ortolan's head, for instance, is greenish-grey, instead of a bright yellow. The song of the male ortolan resembles that of the yellowhammer.          Ortolan nests are placed on or near the ground.          Seeds are the natural diet, but beetles and other insects are taken when feeding their young.          A native of most European countries and western Asia, its distribution throughout its breeding range seems to be very local, and for this no obvious reason can be assigned. It reaches as far north as Scandinavia and beyond the Arctic Circle, frequenting cornfields and their neighbourhoods. It is an uncommon vagrant in spring, and particularly autumn, to the British Isles.          The birds are caught with nets set during their autumn migratory flight to Africa. They are then kept in covered cages or boxes. This ""artificial night"" causes the birds to gorge themselves on grain (usually millet seed) until they double their bulk. ""Roman Emperors stabbed out ortolans’ eyes in order to make the birds think it was night, making them eat even more"". The birds are then thrown into a container of Armagnac which both drowns and marinates the birds.          The bird is roasted for 8 minutes and then plucked. The consumer then places the bird feet first into their mouth while holding onto the bird's head. The ortolan is then eaten whole, or without the head and the consumer spits out the larger bones. The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face with a large napkin or towel while consuming the bird. The purpose of the towel is debated. Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once, others have stated ""Tradition dictates that this is to shield – from God’s eyes – the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act"", and others have suggested the towel hides the consumers spitting out bones. This use of the towel was begun by a priest, a friend of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.          At one time, the island of Cyprus formed a chief depot for the exportation of ortolans, which were pickled in spices and vinegar and packed in casks containing from 300 to 400 each. In the early 20th century, between 400 and 500 casks were annually exported from Cyprus.          Ortolan hunting was banned in France in 1999, but the law was poorly enforced and it is thought that up to 50,000 ortolans were killed each year. According to France’s League for the Protection of Birds, France's ortolan population fell 30 per cent between 1997 and 2007. In 2007, the French government vowed to strictly enforce some existing rules about banning the practice, with the maximum fine set at €6,000 (£4,800). Killing and cooking ortolans is banned across the EU. In 2007, the pressure from France's League for Protection of Birds and from the European Union resulted in the French government promising to enforce the EU directive protecting the ortolan.

In 1995 a second campus for professional education known as the University Polytechnique of Bobo (UPB) was opened in the city of Bobo Dioulasso and a third campus for teacher training and for teacher trainers in Koudougou. In 1996 and in 2005, it became the University of Koudougou. The UO consists of seven Training and Research Units (UFR) and one institute.          The university had around 40,000 students in 2010 (83% of the national population of university students).          The University of Ouagadougou (2005A) consists of seven Training and Research Units (UFR), and one institute: UFR Languages, Arts and Communications; UFR Human sciences; UFR Legal and Politic Sciences; UFR Economic Sciences and Management; UFR Applied Sciences; UFR Health Sciences; UFR Life and Hearth Sciences and Burkinabé Institute of Arts and Crafts. It combines the advantages of faculty (fundamental teaching) and those of an institute (professionalization).          The education system used is the modular educational system based on academic credits, which combines fundamental training and professional training.          For the UFR Languages, Arts and Communications (UFR/LAC) there are two courses: courses in Arts and Communications and courses in letters, languages and linguistics. The unit was created in 2000 and trains students in languages, letters, arts, culture, communication and journalism. The UFR has 2440 students and, for admission, students should have the level of secondary education. For those who do not have that level, an exam is taken.           Students of the faculty take the DEUG (university diploma) after the first cycle, the bachelor’s degree and master in communication and journalism and in interpreting after the 2nd cycle. The last one is the postgraduate diploma and the PhD in linguistics and modern letters taken after the third cycle.          The UFR Human Sciences (UFR/SH) is made up of two branches: History-Geography and Archaeology. It includes four departments and two projects. It has 82 teachers for 4004 students and five student laboratories. The degrees that students take during their studies or at the end are: the DEUG, the bachelor’s degree, the master and the PhD according to their major.          The UFR Legal and Politic Sciences (UFR/SJP) was created in 1975 with two sections: one in Law and Political Science, and the other in Criminology. The UFR trains jurists for the private and public sectors, to promote research in the legal domain, to publish work and researchers publication. For the 2004-2005 academic year there are 25 teachers for 3189 students. The UFR/SJP awards the following degrees: DEUG I, DEUG II, (university diploma) Bachelor’s degree, Master, DESS (postgraduate diploma) and soon DEA and PhD.          The UFR Applied Sciences (UFR/SEA) was created in 2000. It has three departments - Mathematics and Computer, Physics and Chemistry) and 12 laboratories which are available for the students. Like the other UFR, the UFR/SEA awards the same degrees according to the students major.          The UFR Health Sciences (UFR/SDS) was created in 1980 and the UFR Life and Heart Sciences (UFR/SVT). The first one has three branches: courses in medicine with five departments; courses in pharmacy with three departments and health of superior technicians. The faculty prepares doctors, pharmacists, dental surgeons and qualified technicians for hospitals and clinics. The UFR/SDS has 11 laboratories.

3413059,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3413059,Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance,"Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, known in Japan as Fire Emblem: Sōen no Kiseki, is a tactical role-playing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, and published by Nintendo for the GameCube in 2005. It is the ninth main installment in the ""Fire Emblem"" series, and the third to be released in the west. As with previous installments, gameplay revolves around positioning characters on a battlefield with the aim of defeating an opposing force. If characters are defeated in battle, they are removed from the rest of the game.          The story, taking place in a separate world from other ""Fire Emblem"" games, is set in Tellius, a continent inhabited by the humanoid Beorc and the shapeshifting Laguz. Protagonist Ike, a new member of his father's mercenary group, finds a mysterious woman named Elincia Ridell Crimea during a mission. Crimea is invaded by the Beorc nation of Daein. During the group's flight, Ike's father is killed by a Daein general known as the Black Knight. Together with Elincia, who is the last remaining heir to the Crimean throne, Ike and his group travels Tellius to form allegiances with the other countries to free Crimea from Daein's control, confronting racial tensions and long-standing resentment between the Beorc and the Laguz during their travels.          ""Path of Radiance"" began development for the GameCube after the overseas success of the Game Boy Advance game ""Fire Emblem"", becoming the first home console entry in the series since '. The game is the first entry in the series to feature 3D graphics, full motion cutscenes, and voice acting. The series' transition to 3D caused multiple difficulties for the developers. The localization team worked closely with Intelligent Systems to ensure the localization was as true to the original Japanese as possible. Upon release, the game received widespread critical acclaim for its gameplay and story, but several journalistic sites and magazines made negative comments about the game's graphics. The game debuted at the top of Japanese gaming charts, and was considered to have sold well. A direct sequel for the Wii, ', was released in 2007 in North America and Japan, and 2008 in Europe and Australia.          ""Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance"" is a tactical role-playing video game in which players control protagonist Ike and a group of up to 19 characters across multiple battle scenarios. At the game's opening, multiple difficulty settings can be chosen: in the Japanese version the options are Normal, Hard and Maniac modes, while the western versions have Easy, Normal and Hard modes. Characters who fall in battle cannot be revived, being removed from the rest of the game, and no revival items can be used on them during a battle. If Ike falls in battle, the game will end and the level must be restarted. Between battles, characters can be managed at a Base. In this location, weapons can be managed and forged, and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters. Characters' skills can be tailored to a degree, but skills inherent to a particular character cannot be removed or changed, and the amount of skills awarded is limited by the character's skill limit.          During battle, players have access to two species: the humanoid Beorc and the shape-shifting Laguz. Beorc use weapons and magic, while Laguz use close-quarters melee attacks. Laguz have a gauge which fills up during battle, filling at varying speed depending on their status and whether they are under attack. When full they transform into their animal form for a set number of turns. They are unable to attack while in human form, but the time between transformations can be shortened using special items. Playable Beorc characters are each assigned a character class. These classes affect how characters can move on the battlefield, and some are exclusive to certain characters: for example, the Ranger class is exclusive to Ike. Laguz units also have different movement speeds and strengths depending on their transformed form.          Characters used in battle gain experience levels, with larger amounts of experience being awarded depending on a character's performance in battle: once they have 100 experience points, a character automatically levels up. At level 21, a character's class is automatically upgraded. This upgrade can happen at level 10 if the player uses an item called a Master Seal. Once the class changes, the character is reset to level 1, while carrying over all the stat increases aggregated up to that point. Bonus experience is awarded by fulfilling secondary requirements outlined at the beginning of the level.          There is also a Support system, accessible through the Base, where player characters can talk with each other and improve their relationships. These actions improve affinity with a character and grant stat boots in battle. Supports are ranked from C to A, with A being the highest rank.          Battles take place on a grid-based map, with multiple units attached to various sides: the player team, the enemy team, allied characters, and other unaffiliated characters. A character's class (animal form for the Laguz) and the map's terrain can effect how far they can move and how far ranged attacks can be. Gameplay is turn-based, with the player moving, then other factions, with the aim being the defeat of the opposing side. Each turn ends automatically when each character is given their orders. The player can also manually end their turn. The standard commands battling including attacking units, using items, rescuing characters, trade items with other allied characters, and wait until a later turn to receive a command. Special commands include talking to characters in battle, opening chests and visiting places on the map, stealing items, and having characters escape from the map. Ike has the exclusive ability to command all free characters, and the level immediately ends if he escapes.          The series' Weapon Triangle mechanic is present, in which the three main close-combat weapons are strong or weak against each other: axes are strong against lances, lances are strong against swords, and swords are strong against axes. Other similar mechanics exist, such as fire magic being more damaging to some beasts, and arrows being more effective against airborne enemies. Weapon durability decreases over time, with weapons eventually breaking when used enough. Weapons have different levels of strength, with its assigned letter (E to A and S) denoting this. Weapons can also be customized with a unique name. Magic is governed by a similar system to the Weapons Triangle; fire is weak to wind, wind is weak to thunder, and thunder is weak to fire.          As with previous ""Fire Emblem"" games, ""Path of Radiance"" takes place in a continuity and setting separate from the rest of the series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of ""Path of Radiance"", Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.          There are forty six characters encountered through the story that can be recruited, each offering their own contribution to the story. The majority of the main cast comes from the Greil Mercenaries group, led by its founder Greil. The protagonist is Ike, Greil's son. He is accompanied on his travels by Mist, his sister, and Elincia Ridell Crimea, the lost heir to the Crimean Throne. Other Beorc characters include Titania, a former knight of Crimea; and Soren, a mage and tactician. The Laguz characters include Lethe, a cat Laguz with a strong hatred of Beorc; and Caineghis, a lion Beorc who wishes for peaceful co-existence. The antagonists are Dainen generals called the Four Riders, which include the Black Knight, and King Ashnard, the ruler of Daein.          The game opens with Greil recruiting Ike into his mercenaries upon recognizing the threat of Daein. While on a mission, Ike finds a woman who is revealed to be Elincia Ridell Crimea, a princess who was raised in secret due to her existence being a threat to the Crimean order of succession. Daein invades shortly after this, and Greil's mercenaries flee over the border into Gallia. They are pursued by the Black Knight who kills Greil. Ike and Elincia decide to work together and drive the forces of Daein from Crimea. Over the course of the game, Ike and his companions overcome long-held racial tensions between the Beorc and Laguz in order to form an alliance against their true enemy, Ashnard, king of Daein. In particular, Ike manages to re-establish relations between the Beorc nation of Begnion and the few remaining members of the heron Laguz clan, which was annihilated in an act of genocide known as the Serenes Massacre. During the course of their journey, they discover that Ashnard is provoking the war to try and release the dark deity contained inside the Medallion, using Daein's invasion as a template for his plan. In the final assault, Ike and his mercenaries manage to defeat both the Black Knight and Ashnard, thwarting his scheme. With Ashnard defeated and the Daein occupation ended, Elincia is crowned as Crimea's new queen, who works to make the land a place where Beorc and Laguz can live in peace.          Development on ""Path of Radiance"" began at Intelligent Systems after the international success of the first localized game in the series, released overseas under the title ""Fire Emblem"". Due to high development costs, the team had been unwilling to develop a title for the GameCube, but after ""Fire Emblem""s success overseas, they decided to return from portable to home consoles for its next release. Nintendo SPD was also involved in development. ""Path of Radiance"" was the first ""Fire Emblem"" to have 3D in-game graphics, full-motion video cutscenes and voice acting. It was also the first home console game since """" for the Super Famicom. Transitioning from 2D graphics to 3D graphics was one of the biggest challenges during development, especially the transition from the tilted overhead view to a unit-to-unit battle in third-person. One of the features left out due to this process was a dedicated battle arena. At the same time, they introduced the base as members of the development team wanted a place where characters could interact separate from the battlefield. As there was no combat gameplay involved, other types of activity were created, such as special support conversations. To make moves in battle and cutscenes realistic, the team used motion capture, then made sure it appeared a little over the top so the fantasy feeling of the ""Fire Emblem"" series remained intact. By the end of development, Narihiro had some regrets about the quality of the game, saying in an interview that he considered it to be only 70% complete when released.          The character designs were done by Senri Kita, an artist new to the series. In contrast to previous ""Fire Emblem"" games, where the protagonist was of royal blood, the main character Ike was intended to be of lower social rank, a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it. Ike was born from the many ideas for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game, with many people wanting the protagonist everyone could empathize with. His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait by male staff. A character that returned from previous games was Jeigan, who was this time designed as a female character. Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge. This also resulted in higher-quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages. The full-motion videos were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier. Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team. The game's subtitle does not refer to a specific object or place, but instead acts as a metaphor for the journeys of Ike and other characters.          A new ""Fire Emblem"" title was first announced in April 2004, with the full reveal coming in an issue of ""Weekly Shōnen Jump"". The game's title, story details and chosen platform were announced in ""Weekly Shōnen Jump"", with a release date announced as some time during 2004. The game was first shown publicly by Nintendo at their Nintendo World Touch DS event in early 2005. The version of the game displayed there was an early model, and between its reveal and release, it underwent some changes to improve the usability and quality. As a pre-order bonus, Nintendo created a special CD containing selected tracks form the game, and a special calendar commemorating the series' 15th anniversary. The first western demonstration of the title was at E3 2005. It was the third ""Fire Emblem"" title to be localized, after ""Fire Emblem"" and """". Players with save data from the Game Boy Advance ""Fire Emblem"" games are able to connect with ""Path of Radiance"" and access concept art and special maps revolving around characters from those games.          The localization of ""Path of Radiance"" was handled by Nintendo of America's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse. During the process, the team worked closely with Intelligent Systems staff members. The biggest challenge for the team was translating from Japanese to English, which required staff from Japan to come over and check their work. When translating the dialogue, the localization team wanted to preserve the story's depth and serious tone, despite often having a limited text and character space for interaction and expression. While they had the option to add extra text boxes, this would potentially have made going through conversations tedious for players, so they worked to match the number of text boxes used in the Japanese version. Some character names, such as Eirika and Noel (originally Eirik and Knowl) were changed so they could be pronounced more easily while retaining their original meanings. The western version's difficulty was also toned down: the Japanese version's Maniac setting was removed, Hard Mode was toned down, and a new Easy was introduced. These adjustments were based on both western test player feedback, and feedback from Japanese players complaining about the game's high difficulty. The amount of dialogue and text that needed translating was estimated at less than that in ""Animal Crossing"", but still enough to take several months to complete. Due to its serious nature, the team needed to take a different approach to its localization than other Nintendo titles. As far as possible, the team remained faithful to the original script, aside from pieces like jokes which would not have made sense to people unfamiliar with Japanese humor. While most of the time they refrained from putting out-of-context remarks in character dialogue, an exception was Anna, a recurring ""Fire Emblem"" character who featured in optional tutorial missions. As she existed outside the game to a degree, they had more freedom to have her make pop culture references.          In Japan during its opening week, ""Path of Radiance"" sold over 100,357 copies, selling through 64.16% of its initial shipment. By the end of 2005, the game had sold 156,413 copies. In its UK debut, it reached the top of the GameCube charts. Although no exact sales figures have been published, Nintendo cited the game as being among its successful GameCube titles for 2005. According to the developers, the fact that it was released near the end of the GameCube's lifespan affected sales, but it still managed to help sell the hardware and convinced Nintendo that the ""Fire Emblem"" had selling power on home consoles.          Reception of the game was generally positive: on aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic, it received scores of 85% and 85/100 based upon 47 and 42 critic reviews respective. In IGN's GamerMetrics List for 2005 and GameSpot's 2005 Readers' Choice award, ""Path of Radiance"" was at #2 in their respective lists behind ""Resident Evil 4"". The game was among those nominated at the 2006 Golden Joystick Awards in the ""Nintendo Game of the Year"" category. The game was named by GamesRadar was one of the best GameCube games of all time in 2014, and Destructoid listed it among the five best ""Fire Emblem"" games in the series in 2013.          ""Famitsu""s reviewers each praised the gameplay, story, and the introduction of full-motion movies. One reviewer cited it as the series' new exemplar, while another pointed out rough edges in the graphical redesign and that the new 3D perspective made seeing some parts of the map difficult. 1UP.com's Shane Betternhausen was positive overall, saying ""[""Path of Radiance""] delivers a superbly paced and rewarding adventure"". RPGamer's Chris Privitere said ""While Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance doesn't necessarily add anything new to the tactical genre, it does everything very well"", recommending it to players while stressing the need for patience. Peer Schneider of IGN called the game ""yet another worthy installment in Intelligent Systems' venerable strategy RPG series"". RPGFan reviewer Mark Tjan said that while not the best ""Fire Emblem"" game he had played, ""it's certainly a good game and worth picking up if you're searching for an SRPG worth your time and money"". Nintendo World Report's Karl Castaneda was also highly positive, though commenting that its graphical quality were more suited to the early days of the GameCube's life and that it might have been a great success if released during that period. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the ""Fire Emblem"" formula, enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished. Greg Kasavin, writing for GameSpot, saying that ""by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role-playing games with a fun and exciting turn-based combat system, and by going out of its way to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role-playing games attempt, but very few actually manage to do"". The majority of praise went to the game's story and gameplay, while criticism was focused on the graphical quality.          The team's successful return to a home console convinced them to carry on the story of Tellius in another home console release. The next entry, """", began development in May 2005 for the Wii. It was released in 2007 in Japan and North America, and 2008 in Europe and Australia. Protagonist Ike has also appeared as a playable fighter in ""Super Smash Bros.

For instance, this is the case of classical field theory on fiber bundles (covariant classical field theory).          The variational bicomplex is a cochain complex of the differential graded algebra of exterior forms on jet manifolds of sections of a fiber bundle. Lagrangians and Euler–Lagrange operators on a fiber bundle are defined as elements of this bicomplex. Cohomology of the variational bicomplex leads to the global first variational formula and first Noether's theorem.          Extended to Lagrangian theory of even and odd fields on graded manifolds, the variational bicomplex provides strict mathematical formulation of classical field theory in a general case of reducible degenerate Lagrangians and the Lagrangian BRST theory.","['Calculus of variations', 'Differential equations', 'Differential geometry']"

The album features an electronic based sound, differing from their previous pop-rock and acoustic releases, that was accented with the use of synthesizers, sampling, drum programming and vocal processing effects. The lyrical content of the album is centered heavily around heartbreak, which some critics noted its contrast to the electronic elements presented.          ""Insomniatic"" was well received by many music critics, many of which lauded the duo for the lyrical depth and evolution. Others, however, label the composition of the album to be bland and unoriginal. The album debuted at number 15 on the ""Billboard"" 200 with sales of 39,000. Two singles were spawned from the album. The first single, ""Potential Breakup Song"", was released on June 26, 2007 and became charted within the top 30 in several countries, including the United States where it peaked at number 17. ""Like Whoa"" was released as the album's second single in early 2008 and charted in the lower regions of the charts.          The album was the duo's final release with Hollywood Records and under the name Aly & AJ. They changed their name to 78violet in 2009 and again changed it to Aly & AJ in 2015. They left Hollywood in 2010 before forming their own label 78violet Music LLC.          MTV's ""The Leak"" section posted all 12 songs on the standard edition of the album in their entirety, on July 3, 2007. The song ""Blush"" was excluded in the MTV.com full album stream as well not being included in the iTunes edition. The song ""Like Whoa"" was featured in an episode of MTV's ""The Hills"" and the girls' made-for-TV (MTV) movie ', which premiered on July 8, 2007 and in ' on October 24, 2008. The song eventually became the album's second single.          Instrumental versions of all 12 songs are available commercially on the iTunes Store, alongside the standard 12-track album with vocals. The album's title is not actually a word (""insomniac"" serves as both a noun and an adjective); the definition of ""Insomniatic"" as stated by them is: ""A state of mind where one becomes addicted to the deprivation of sleep caused by an epic revelation of joy"". The Australian release of the album features the cover art same as the deluxe edition, aside from the ""Deluxe Edition"" tag. It also features with the original ""Chemicals React"" track as the first track, following the rest of the standard album.          ""Insomniatic"" is primary an electro rock album that focuses instrumentally on the usage of synthesizers, drum programming, synthesized drums, sampling, loops and vocoders, creating a synthesized sound throughout. The set encompasses numerous genres including rock, pop, electronica, new wave, and Europop. The lyrical themes of the album are centered on heartbreak and loss. The first song, ""Potential Breakup Song"", is composed as an electropop song that incorporates elements of electronica, electro-rock and dance in its composition. The song's lyrics describe a situation in which certain instances have led to the dissolution of a union. The title track is an electro rock number that consists of instrumentation from ""striking"" drums and ""quick"" guitar riffs. The duo, who harmonizes throughout the song, speak of the feeling derived from insomnia. ""Silence"" features an opening consisting of a soft percussion and the accompaniment of synthesized instruments and piano with the vocals. ""Like Whoa"" differs from the rest of the album in sound as it runs through an upbeat dance rhythm and electronic beats, similar to those in ""Bullseye"", while incorporating sounds of an amusement park ride and new wave music. ""Blush"" is a lite ballad that features hints of sexual tension and suggestiveness in the lyrics. ""Bullseye"", along with ""If I Could Have You Back"" and ""Like or Leave It"", blend 70s and 80s guitar tones with electronic beats. ""Closure"" is an electro pop ballad that is composed of synthesizer keyboards and distorted guitars.          The album debuted at #15 in the official United States ""Billboard"" 200 albums chart, selling over 39,000 copies in its first week, becoming Aly & AJ's highest debut to date. ""Insomniatic"" remained on the charts for 18 weeks in total, dropping out after the fourteenth week, to re-enter six weeks later.          Kathi Kamen Goldmark of ""Common Sense Media"" gave the album four out of five stars, praising the duo's vocals and the ""gentle undertone of self-esteem and standing up for yourself in relationships"" as ""refreshing"". She further commented that the album was ""better written than their first album"" and that ""the highs of flirtation, the confusion that comes with being caught in the undertow of sexual attraction while taking care of yourself and setting limits, and the sadness and disappointment of breaking up"" were ""all described in well-constructed songs containing G-rated imagery."" Sari N. Kent of ""TheCelebrityCafe"" wrote positively about the album, writing in her review that the album ""will make listeners jump up and take notice of this harmonic twosome. Their active beats will infect listeners' ears and make them want to dance whether they want to or not."" Logan Leasure of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote that the album ""offers some positive content through brokenness, but this is not an album worth presenting to someone looking for Christ."" Caroline Sullivan of ""The Guardian"" rated the album an A, praising ""the effect of which is to leave the listener suspended between hyped-up delight and despair at the micro-produced perfection of it all"" and the songwriting/production team for crafting ""lush, assertive little symphonies with massive hooklines that make the most of the sisters' Britneyish breathiness."" T2 of ""Tommy2.Net"" gave ""Insomniatic"" a three out of four star rating, praising the evolution of lyrics and sound present by the Michalka sisters. ""Sputnikmusic"" wrote positively about the album, praising it as ""an underrated pop-rock album with solid songwriting, stellar production, and first-rate vocals."" The website also found the lyrics to be heartfelt and named ""Potential Breakup Song"", ""Silence"" and ""If I Could Have You Back"" as standout tracks. Chuck Eddy of ""Billboard"" in a positive review of the album described ""Insomniatic"" as ""an endlessly ambitious yet endlessly effervescent confessional pop-rock breakup album that deserves to carry them far beyond their teen pop base.""          The album was released on 10 July 2007 in the United States, on 22 October 2007 in the United Kingdom and Italy — with a new cover art — and ultimately in Singapore in April 2008. An enhanced Deluxe Edition was released in Japan on 5 March 2008. The cover of the Deluxe Edition (aside from the ""deluxe edition"" tag) was used for an Australian release on 15 March 2008.

4811750,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4811750,Colerne,"Colerne is a village and civil parish in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in west Wiltshire, England. The village is about west of the town of Corsham and northeast of the city of Bath. It has an elevated and exposed position, above sea level, and overlooks the Box valley to the south (where Brunel's Box Tunnel is).          The parish includes the hamlets of Eastrip and Thickwood. It is bounded to the west by a stretch of the Fosse Way Roman road, which forms the county boundary with Gloucestershire, and to the east by the Bybrook River. Part of the northern boundary is the Doncombe Brook, a tributary of the Bybrook, and part of the southern boundary is the Lid Brook, another tributary.          Evidence of early settlement in the area includes three bowl barrows near Thickwood, overlooking the Bybrook valley, and an Iron Age hillfort from around 100 BC in the north of the parish, known as Bury Wood Camp, overlooking the Doncombe valley.          A Roman villa has been found on the site of the present airfield. The 1086 Domesday Book recorded 28 households at Colerne and six at Thickwood. The enclosure known as Colerne Park (today largely woodland) was created in the early 14th century by William of Colerne, Abbot of Malmesbury.          In the 14th century the local economy was based on sheep-rearing, cloth production (assisted by mills on the By Brook) and stone quarrying. The former farmhouse known as Daubenys, on the High Street, is a long house from c. 1400, now Grade II* listed.          The Manor House, near the church, bears a date of 1689. The country house at Lucknam Park was built in the late 17th century. Many houses in the village are from the 18th century, partly as a result of a large fire of 1774.          By the 19th century, cloth-making had migrated to industrial towns and the economy was mainly agricultural. Some of the watermills were converted to paper production, an example being Chapps Mill near Slaughterford. In the 1840s many labourers were employed on the construction of the Great Western Railway and its Box Tunnel.          From 1939, employment was provided by the construction of RAF Colerne close to the north of the village, followed by its operation and later use as an Army base.          The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist dates from the 13th century; it has a 15th-century tower and was restored in the 19th century. There are fragments of medieval glass, and pieces of a 9th-century cross shaft which Pevsner describes as ""two large fragments of one of the best C9 crosses in the West Country"". In 1960 the church was designated as Grade I listed.          A Congregational chapel was built in 1824 and renovated in 1924; in 1974 it became Colerne Evangelical Church and joined the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches.          In 1867, Providence Strict Baptist Chapel was opened in Colerne. The building fell into disuse in 1986 and is now a private house.          A Primitive Methodist chapel was built in Colerne in 1895 and closed in 1984. An earlier small Methodist chapel was built at Thickwood in 1860 but was demolished in 1904.          Colerne's historic core sits on a high ridge, though some of its stone-built houses are located down the valley side to the south. Modern estates were built to the north of the ancient, narrow streets, and there is some modern infill. Thickwood is a separate development of mainly late twentieth century houses to the northeast.          Colerne CE Primary School serves the village. Its building was opened in 1965 to replace a small National School of 1853, near the church. Pupil numbers were high while the school served families from RAF Colerne, and classrooms at the old school remained in use until the RAF station closed in 1976. In 2015 the old school was in use by a pre-school playgroup.          Calder House School is an independent special school at Thickwood.          The village has two pubs, in buildings from the early 18th century: the ""Fox and Hounds"" and the ""Six Bells Inn"". There is a village hall, a post office and several shops.          The Lucknam Park Hotel, originally a Georgian country house but much expanded in the Victorian era, is located around north of the village, near Thickwood.          Colerne Park and Monk's Wood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, south and east of the village.          As the ""Village on the Hill"", Colerne is in an exposed position and local people are well aware that the weather will often be the opposite of that in nearby, but low lying, Bath. Colerne tends to be very windy and rainy in winter and prone to get cut off from the outside world when it snows. It can often be foggy when the lower lying towns and villages around aren't.          The name Colerne appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. Other early spellings include ""Culerna"", ""Culerne"", ""Cullerne"", ""Collern"". Various interpretations of the name have been proposed. Gover, Mawer and Stenton, in ""The Place Names of Wiltshire"", cite a form ""aern"" meaning 'house', and say """"col-aern"" might well denote a house where charcoal was made, used or stored."" Or, the altitude of the village suggests that the first syllable is from the Welsh or Cornish word ""col"", 'peak'; this would mean the 'dwelling on the peak'. Alternatively it could mean 'cold dwelling' from the Anglo-Saxon ""cald"".          Yet another possible derivation is from (Goidelic)= Old Irish, 'Cuillean', (Brythonnic)= Welsh, Celyn or Celynnen, and (Old English) Holegn (the 'h' is pronounced gutturally). Each of these words translate to 'holly tree' or 'holly branches' which were significant in Celtic history and folklore.          Colerne civil parish is administered by a parish council and by the Wiltshire Council unitary authority.          According to village legend, a Colerne parson in former years owned a donkey to which he was much attached. While the clergyman was away, the unfortunate ass died, and the sexton felt it proper to have the beast buried in consecrated ground. But the undertaker, inexperienced in interring specimens of ""E. asinus"", neglected to dig the grave wide and deep enough, so the donkey was buried feet-up with its hooves sticking out. The parson had the animal reburied when he returned, but the story was already out, and well into the 20th century young men from the nearby villages of Box or Marshfield who were at a loose end needed only visit Colerne and mention the word ""Donkey"" sufficiently loudly to be rewarded with a violent altercation on a moment's notice. It was also the habit for visiting footballers unacquainted with Colerne history to be dispatched to the home dressing room with a piece of sandpaper and instructions to ask to polish the donkey's hooves.          Two mysterious stones were visible the wall opposite the church entrance as late as the 1970s. These were just part of the wall and without closer inspection no different from their neighbours. One, at ground level, had a faint inscription ""A Black Man Died Here"". A nearby stone had a visible hand print in it as clear as if someone has pressed their hand in clay – though this was limestone. Local children connected the two into a story of a man falling from the church tower centuries earlier. Sadly neither the inscription or the hand are visible now, presumably due to weathering.          The counties of Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Somerset meet in the far southwest of the parish, on the Fosse Way. The Shire Stones, made from coarsely cut stone slabs, mark this point. This marker was erected in 1736 and rebuilt in 1859.          The Colerne Water Tower is a large concrete structure in the shape of an inverted cone. It is approximately 30 meters (100 ft) high, and replaced an older tower that was part of a 1930s scheme to bring mains water to the area. The location of the present tower, on the southern edge of Colerne Airfield, is shown as ""Wr Twr"" on the current Ordnance Survey maps (1:25,000 and 1:50,000).          The original tower was located on the eastern edge of the village near the housing estate called Martins Croft (built in the late 1940s-early '50s). The Colerne History Group's book, ""The Village on the Hill, Vol. 1"", tells the story of this project. In 2005, housing was built on the site of the original tower and that development is called Tower Close.","['Villages in Wiltshire', 'Civil parishes in Wiltshire']"

Serving as mayor of Edmonton, Alberta from 2004 to 2013, he was elected to three terms in 2004, 2007, and 2010, after sitting on council as a councillor for three years.          On September 15, 2014, he was appointed to the provincial cabinet of Premier Jim Prentice as Minister of Health, despite not holding a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. He was subsequently named as the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party's candidate in a by-election in Edmonton-Whitemud, the seat formerly held by Dave Hancock, which has been scheduled for October 27, 2014. He ran and was defeated in the election on May 5, 2015.          Mandel received an associate of arts degree from Lincoln College in Lincoln, Illinois, a bachelor of science in business administration from Miami University, and his masters in political science from the University of Windsor.          He moved to Edmonton in 1972 from Windsor, Ontario.          Mandel owns the Strathcona County’s Lakeland Village mobile home park.          Mandel was active with promoting the city's arts and festival scene. He is also an active volunteer with the city's local Heart and Stroke Foundation and with several local Jewish organizations.          Prior to being elected to city council, Mandel ran unsuccessfully for school trustee He was first elected to the Edmonton City Council in 2001 as a councillor for Ward 1. In 2004, he became mayor by defeating Edmonton's three-term mayor, Bill Smith. Mandel credits his successes to the hard work and spirit of cooperation of his council. Mandel resigned as Mayor of Edmonton on October 29, 2013.          Mandel's city council was responsible for many infrastructural achievements: expansion of the LRT lines, the construction of a new arena for the Edmonton Oilers.          After years of public consultations since 2008, the city approved a plan gradually decommission the City Centre airport by implementing the City Centre Redevelopment Plan. The City Centre Redevelopment Plan aims to mitigate urban sprawl by redeveloping the aging and costly City Center Airport into a sustainable 300 acre inner city neighbourhood anticipated to accommodate 30,000 residents.          According to sporting organization 'SportAccord', the city has a Silver class partnership with the convention, enabling Edmonton to host many world classed events awarded during the Mandel administration. The city is one of six host cities of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.          Edmonton Oilers CEO Daryl Katz has entered into an agreement with the city of Edmonton to joint finance the construction of a new arena for the hockey team which the city will own. The entertainment complex, arena and plaza along with neighbourhood development, and adjacent Winter Garden LRT Station costing $35M has an estimated budget of $601 Million CAD. The project will be financed between the city with a seed fund valued at $219M CAD. Katz Group will contribute $143M and invest in the neighbouring land development. The Albertan government won't fund the arena as Mandel anticipated however the provincial government inadvertently funded $170M through the Municipal Sustainability Initiative. $125M will be raised through ticket surcharges.          Responding to an upsurge of domestic spousal violence in 2006, Mandel together with the Alberta Council for Women's Shelters hosted the first 'Breakfast with guys' peace seminar aimed at curbing violence. The event inspired Edmonton's business leaders raise awareness and support among their staff and community. This initiative has since been replicated globally.          To address the needs of Edmonton's Aboriginal community the city conducted the 'Edmonton Urban Aboriginal Accord Initiative Project', many important documents and agreements with Treaty 6 natives, 'as an accord between Edmonton and the Aboriginal community' were written.          In 2011 Mandel commissioned the 'Community Sustainability Task Force', to address problems that mature Edmontonian neighborhoods faced. The organization reported on recommendations through the 'ELEVATE' report.          Mandel negotiated with the county of Leduc to amalgamate, 15,600 Acres of land to be used to support Edmonton's anticipated growth, if approved it will be the first major growth since 1982.          IBM granted 400,000 USD worth of expertise and advice to assist local experts in improving the lives of Edmontonians through the effective use of data and technology, listing the city as a 2011 Smart Cities Challenge winner.          In 2012, Mandel embarked on a trade mission to meet business and municipal leaders from Asia, to assert Edmonton's place in global Energy and business trade.          In 2013, city council approved to support the UofA as home of the Canadian Women's Basketball team, the city will grant 500,000 CAD over 4 years to develop the sport such as introducing youth to the game.          The city of Edmonton and the aboriginals Treaty 6 commenced on a dialog to address the needs of Aboriginal Edmontonians. In 2005 the two parties signed with the Edmonton Urban Aboriginal Accord.          Mandel started the first Mayor Pride Brunch, in 2005. The event is a fund raiser to raise money for gay pride youth Camp fYrefly. Mandel proclaimed a week in April 2013 as Transgender Awareness week to bring awareness of the challenges Transgender Edmontonians face such as violence.          In 2006–2011 the city administration has been criticized by some members of the local press on issues relating to infrastructure maintenance.          In September 2007, Mandel ordered the removal from city property of work by Edmonton sculptor Ryan McCourt, after receiving a 700-name petition that alleged McCourt's sculptures had ""hurt Hindu religious sensibilities"".          Mandel created the Mayor's Evening for the Arts held at the Francis Winspear Center, out of formerly a luncheon event to an annual festive evening gala. The event showcases the talents of Edmontonian performing artists in a grand spectacle and awards ceremony. In 2012, he celebrated the 25th Anniversary of this tradition. In 2013, Mandel created the 'Ambassador of the Arts Award' awarded at the gala. Honoring significant contributions by individuals or corporations who represented Edmonton artistically on the international or national stage.          Mandel proclaimed the Edmonton Public Library's centennial anniversary to be 'Edmonton Public Library Day' issuing free library membership.          To address the challenges of evolving into metropolises, Mandel, together with Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, negotiated a memorandum of understanding with the Alberta government.This motion will enable both mayors to work with the Alberta government to draft city charters in 2013, effectively articulating the powers and responsibilities the municipalities have to deal with unique issues of development such as taxation.          Although not yet a member of the Legislative Assembly, Mandel was named as Minister of Health by Alberta premier Jim Prentice in the fall of 2014. Two months later, he would win the seat vacated by Dave Hancock (Edmonton-Whitemud) in a by-election. He went on to serve as health minister and MLA until the defeat of the Progressive Conservatives, and the loss of his own seat to NDP candidate Bob Turner, in the 2015 election.","['1945 births', 'Edmonton city councillors', 'Living people', 'Mayors of Edmonton', 'Miami University alumni', 'Politicians from Windsor, Ontario', 'University of Windsor alumni', 'Members of the Executive Council of Alberta', 'Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta MLAs', 'Lincoln College (Illinois) alumni', 'Jewish mayors of places in Canada']"

Grouping plants into hydrozones is an approach to irrigation and planting design where plants with similar water needs are grouped together. Through the practice of hydrozoning, it is possible to customize irrigation schedules for each area’s needs, improving efficiency and avoiding overwatering and underwatering certain plants and grasses. As you move farther away from the water source your plantings require less water. For example, drought tolerant plants such as sage or cactus would not be planted in a bluegrass lawn, but would be separated, since bluegrass has a higher water requirement. The principal hydrozone is found in local parks and gathering places such as urban plazas and spaces around well-used public buildings. Mixing plants with different water needs can result in over-watering of water-thrifty plants or under-watering of plants requiring regular moisture.","['Horticulture and gardening', 'Irrigation']"
42775352,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42775352,Cast acrylic,"Cast Acrylic is a form of poly(methyl methacylate) (PMMA). It is formed by casting the monomer, methyl methacrylate, mixed with initiators and possibly other additives into a form or mold. Sheet and rod stock are generated by casting into static forms, while tubing is done in rotational molds.          It has better thermal stability, higher resistance to crazing (when a network of very small cracks form) when exposed to solvents, wider thermoforming range than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic has better ability to be reworked hot and it is known for its superior surface finish and optical properties. Also cast acrylic is more scratch resistant than extruded acrylic.          Cast acrylic is also preferred over extruded in applications that require machining, such as turning on Engine Lathe or milling/drilling. Extruded acrylic, with far less thermal stability, tends to melt and clog cutting tools. Even with slow speeds and lots of coolant, extruded acrylic does not produce the surface finish and tight tolerances achievable with cast acrylic.          This type of acrylic is often used for aquariums, awards, financial tombstones, trophies, corporate gifts, and other products that require shaping or machining. It tends to be more clear and made to a higher quality standard, but in doing so makes it more expensive than extruded acrylic.          http://www.cutplasticsheeting.co.uk/clear-acrylic-sheeting/clear-cast-acrylic.html          http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2008/03/14/a_modders_guide_to_acrylic/1          http://www.pmma.dk/Acryl_stobt_kontra_ekstruderet.aspx?Lang=en-GB",['Plastics industry']
18985052,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18985052,Union Steamship Company of British Columbia,"The Union Steamship Company of British Columbia was a pioneer firm on coastal British Columbia. It was founded in November 1889 by John Darling, a director of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and nine local businessmen. The company began by offering local service on Burrard Inlet near Vancouver and later expanded to servicing the entire British Columbia coast. Initially a cross-harbour service with the steamers ""Senator"" and ""Lonsdale"", the line was asked to take on more roles, calling in at Howe Sound, Gibsons Landing, and various logging camps and sawmills. The demand outstripped the availability of vessels.          There was an initial capital base of £40,000 allowed for the purchase of three tugboats and seven barges, the foundation of the Union Company fleet. Between 1891 and 1911, the Company went on to build ten additional vessels, all but two from shipyards in Scotland and Ireland. In 1891 three Scottish made ships were assembled in Coal Harbour—the ""Capilano"", ""Coquitlam"", and ""Cowichan""—and these hulls started the modern company. The fleet expanded over the years with C named steamers: the ""Cassiar"", ""Chehalis"", ""Cardero"", and ""Cheslakee"". Later the company built a Lady series, ""Lady Alexandra"", ""Lady Celia"" for example. The company was a lifeline for loggers, settlers and fish camps in a land without roads or cars. Boat day was a big event for many community as the steamer would bring in families, food and mail.          Between 1891 and 1911, the Company went on to build ten additional vessels, all but two from shipyards in Scotland and Ireland. During this period and beyond, the Company barely survived a number of misfortunes and ill-fated ventures, to eventually emerge as the principal steamship link to the growing resource industries of the central and north coast of the province.          While the period from 1911 to 1920 was for the Company a time of consolidation of its routes and services after a decade of expansion, marine trade was slowed by the outbreak of war in 1914. Economic recovery did not begin until the United States entered the war in 1917, giving a much-needed boost to the coastal lumber industry. But by the fall of 1922, the booming coastal salmon industry’s increasing need for dependable marine transport for its product had convinced the Union Company that an additional ship was required for the northern cannery run. Accordingly, the Scots firm of Napier and Miller at Old Kilpatrick on the River Clyde were engaged to build a large, modern vessel capable of meeting this burgeoning demand.           The Union Steamship Company was bought out by the Canadian Pacific Steamships in 1948 in a marriage at the Senior Home.          The fire in Toronto forced the Federal Maritime Department to change marine regulations          regarding wooden passenger vessels, while the nature of the BC coastal fleet changed more to freight and a tug and barge operation. The Union Steamships ran until 1956 when a strike finished the fleet.          The assets of the Company were taken over by Northland Navigation in 1962.          The line had a good safety record in an age before satellites and radar. The ""Chehalis"" sank off Brockton Point in 1913 with a loss of life; the ""Cheslakee"" capsized on Texada Island; and the ""Comox"" collided with a ship in fog in Malaspina Strait. It should be remembered that this is over 50 years and a service of dozens of ships.","['1889 establishments in British Columbia', 'Defunct shipping companies of Canada', 'Union Steamship Company of British Columbia']"

In her brief career she captured one French privateer.           ""Rover"" was designed by Goodrich & Co., and Captain Francis Pender contracted her building in October 1795. She was initially planned as a brig, but during construction she was lengthened and given a full ship rig. An Admiralty Order of 10 November 1795 agreed the purchase, and she was added to the establishment by a second Admiralty Order dated 1 January 1796. She was purchased on the stocks and launched in 1796.          ""Rover"" was rated as a sloop and she was commissioned as such in April 1798 under Commander George Irwin.          On 16 May 1798 ""Rover"" was sailing towards Bermuda when she captured and sent in the French privateer sloop ""Jean Bart"". ""Jean Bart"" was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 57 men. She was last in Porto Rico and had captured three American ships:          ""Rover"" was wrecked in the Gulf of St Lawrence on 23 June 1798, but her crew were saved. She was convoying the transport ""Elizabeth"" to Quebec when she entered a fog. The pilot got a brief sight of land that he believed was Scaterie Island. As a result, he was comfortable continuing to maintain course. When lookouts spotted breakers ahead early in the evening it was too late to turn her and she struck rocks on Cape Breton Island. Eventually a seaman was able to swim to shore with a line that the crew then used to leave ""Rover"", which was by then filling rapidly with water. All the men reached the shore and the crew finally abandoned her on 26 June, at which time they sailed her boats to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The court martial attributed the loss of ""Rover"" to a very strong current.","['Sloops of the Royal Navy', '1796 ships', 'Maritime incidents in 1798', 'Ships built in Bermuda', 'Shipwrecks of the Nova Scotia coast']"

It was one of the most popular songs of the early 20th century. The publisher, Forster Music Publisher, Inc., sold 4 million copies.          The song was written in 1908 while Taylor was sitting on the banks of the Blanchard River in northwest Ohio in the city of Findlay. Reportedly, Taylor's friends persuaded him not to publish the song, believing it did not have commercial value. Two years later in 1910, however, the song was published and introduced to the public with performances by the vaudeville quartet The Orpheus Comedy Four. After the group performed the song at a Woolworth store in Kansas City, it became so popular that the store sold out all one thousand of the copies of its sheet music Taylor had brought with him. Since then, over four million copies of its sheet music have been sold, and it has become a staple for barbershop quartets.

Although Case apparently left no writings, he was one of the first Talmudic authorities of his time, as may be seen from Benjamin Aaron Solnik's ""responsum"" No. 22, and Meïr ben Gedaliah of Lublin's ""responsum"" No. 88. Case's son Solomon (died January 2, 1612, at Lemberg) was also an eminent Talmudist.","['Polish rabbis', '16th-century births', '1610s deaths']"

MaxDB is targeted for large SAP environments e.g. mySAP Business Suite and other applications that require enterprise-level database functionality.          The database development started in 1977 as a research project at the Technical University of Berlin headed by Rudolf Munz. In the early 1980s it became a database product that subsequently was owned by Nixdorf Computer, Siemens-Nixdorf, Software AG and today by SAP AG. It has at various times been named VDN, RDS, Reflex, Supra 2, DDB/4, Entire SQL-DB-Server and Adabas D. In 1997 SAP acquired the software from Software AG and developed it as SAP DB, releasing the source code under the GNU General Public License in October 2000.          In 2003 SAP AG and MySQL AB jointly re-branded the database system to MaxDB. In October 2007 this reselling agreement was terminated and sales and support of the database reverted to SAP. SAP AG now manages MaxDB development, distribution, and support. New versions of the source code of MaxDB are no longer available under the GNU General Public License. SAP also stated that ""Further commercial support concepts to cover mission critical use requirements outside of SAP scenarios are currently subject to discussion.""          Version 7.5 of MaxDB is based on the code base of SAP DB 7.4. Therefore, the MaxDB software version 7.5 can be used as a direct upgrade of previous SAP DB versions starting 7.2.04 and higher.          MaxDB is delivered with a set of administration and development tools. Most tools are available both a GUI based and with command line interface (CLI). It offers bindings for JDBC; ODBC; SQLDBC (native C/C++ interface); Precompiler; PHP; Perl; Python; WebDAV; OLE DB, ADO, DAO, RDO and .NET via ODBC; Delphi and Tcl via Third Party Programming Interfaces.

38678768,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38678768,Memnon (horse),"Memnon (foaled 1822) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for winning the classic St Leger Stakes in 1825. In a racing career which lasted from 1824 until 1828 he ran fifteen times and won nine races. Bred and originally trained in Yorkshire, he was unbeaten in two races as two-year-old in 1824, including the Champagne Stakes and won the York version of the St Leger the following spring. In the St Leger at Doncaster in September 1825, he was successful as the heavily backed favourite in a record field of thirty runners. Memnon was later trained at Newmarket and recorded his most important subsequent victory when winning the Ascot Gold Cup as a five-year-old in 1827. After standing as a breeding stallion for five years in England with moderate results, he was sold and exported to Russia.          Memnon was a ""long, loose, big and leggy"" bay horse with one white foot bred at Bishop Burton in Yorkshire by Richard Watt. Memnon was sired by the Duke of Grafton's horse Whisker who won the 1815 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful breeding stallion. His dam Manuella, who was also bred by Richard Watt, won the Epsom Oaks in 1812 and retired from racing to become a broodmare at Watt's stud. Apart from Memnon, she produced the successful racehorses Belzoni and Belshazar, as well as the influential broodmare Margellina.          Memnon made his first racecourse appearance on 18 September at the St Leger meeting at Doncaster Racecourse. He started the 4/5 favourite for the second running of the Champagne Stakes, one of the year's most important races for two-year-olds. Ridden by Bill Scott, he won from Lord Queensberry's colt The Alderman and two others. Five days later he faced twelve opponents in a sweepstakes over the same course and distance. Memnon won at odds of 5/1, with The Alderman again taking second place.          Memnon made his first appearance of the season at York Racecourse on 9 May when he contested a ""St Leger Stakes"". The success of the St Leger at Doncaster had led other major courses, including York and Newmarket to use the name for their own long distance races for three-year-olds; the original race was renamed the ""Great St Leger"" for several years to distinguish itself from the imitators. Memnon started 4/6 favourite for the York race, and won from Lord Kelburne's colt Dare Devil.          After a break of more than four months, Memnon returned for the fiftieth running of the Great St Leger at Doncaster on 20 September. Ridden as usual by Bill Scott, he started the 3/1 favourite against twenty-nine colts and fillies, the largest field assembled for the classic up to that time. Memnon won the race easily by three lengths from his old rival The Alderman. The beaten horses included a filly named Fleur de Lis who was reportedly ""thrown down"" during the race. Betting on the race had been heavy and among the winners were Robert Ridsdale and John Gully, who reportedly won £31,000 and £16,000 respectively on the result.          By the time he appeared in the Gascoigne Stakes two days later Memnon had been sold by Watt for 3,500 guineas to Lord Darlington, later to become the 1st Duke of Cleveland. The colt won the prize for his new owner without having to race as the other eight entries were withdrawn, allowing him to walk over.          Memnon's third season began when he ran in the Gold Cup at Manchester Racecourse in Lancashire on 18 May. He started odds-on favourite against three opponents, but lost his undefeated record as he was beaten by a filly named Signorina. Memnon returned to Yorkshire in August for the four-year-old division of the Great Subscription Purse. He was made 2/7 favourite, but was defeated by his only opponent, Lord Kelburne's colt Actaeon.          A year after his classic win, Memnon appeared at Doncaster in September, but avoided potential clashes with Fleur-de-Lis and Actaeon in the Doncaster Stakes and Doncaster Cup as a result of some ""blundering"" with his entries. Instead, he walked over for a sweepstakes over the St Leger course on 20 September and won a four-mile event on the following afternoon. In the latter race he defeated the five-year-old Florismart by half a head after a ""beautiful and severe race"".          For the 1827 season, Memnon was moved south to be trained at Newmarket by William Chifney, and was ridden in most of his subsequent races by his new trainer's brother Samuel Chifney, Jr.. On 15 May at Newmarket Racecourse, Memnon made his five-year-old debut in a 1,000 guinea match race over ten furlongs in which he easily defeated Lord Exeter's Enamel, the winner of the 1822 2000 Guineas. A month later, Memnon appeared at Ascot Racecourse where he contested the twenty-first running of the Gold Cup. Ridden by Sam Chifney, he started 1/2 favourite for the two and a half mile race and won impressively by two lengths from King George IV's horse Mortgage and three others.          In autumn, Memnon appeared at the Doncaster St Leger meeting for the fourth year in succession, but on this occasion, he failed to win a race. On 18 September he lost by a neck to Fleur-de-Lis at level weights in the two-mile Doncaster Stakes. Two days later he started second favourite for the Doncaster Cup over two miles five furlongs against a field which included Fleur-de-Lis, Actaeon and the 1826 St Leger winner Tarrare. He dead-heated with Fleur-de-Lis for second place behind Lord Fitzwilliam's four-year-old Mulatto. Memnon was scheduled to run a three-mile match race against The Alderman at Newmarket in October, but his opponent failed to appear, leaving Lord Darlington to collect a 250 guineas forfeit.          Memnon remained in training as a six-year-old but failed to show any worthwhile form. In April he finished last of the five runners when carrying top weight of 128 pounds in the two-mile Oatlands Stakes at Newmarket, and a month later finished third of four behind Chateau Margaux in the Jockey Club Plate over the four-mile Beacon Course. In October Memnon was scheduled to challenge for The Whip, a silver trophy which was said to incorporate hairs from the tail and mane of Eclipse, but he failed to appear for the race, allowing Colonel Wilson's Lamplighter to claim the prize.          Memnon was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Lord Cleveland's stud at Raby Castle. By 1831 he was standing at a fee of 10 guineas a mare at J Painter's stables at Dean's Hill, Staffordshire. The most successful of his British offspring was King Cole, who won the Chester Cup in 1838. In 1833 he was sold and exported to Russia.","['1822 racehorse births', 'Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom', 'Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom', 'British Classic Race winners', 'Thoroughbred family 11-g']"

January 27, 2010 ) was a Mexican painter whose work has been exhibited in both North and South America and recognized with membership in the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana.          Lazos was born in Cuernavaca, where she remained based for her life and career. In 1954, she graduated a program for art teachers at the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos. From 1958 to 1959, she took classes in modern dance with Luis Alonso. For a time, she was undecided between a career in painting or in dance.          In 1963, she met painter Dr Atl at the Instituto Regional de Bellas Artes, proposing with him the idea of creating a socialist science center in the town of Tepoztlán. While she had Atl’s support, and was named secretary of the institution, Atl fell ill and died in 1964, and the project withered.          In 1965 she married painter Rafael Mazón at the Cuernavaca Cathedal. Living on Chulavista Street in the city, the couple had one child named Tláloc Rafael.          In 1985, she donated a work to PROMOVOR to raise money for the victims of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.          In the early 1990s, she and her family were invited to meet writer Andrés Henestrosa, then in San Francisco Ixhuatlán, Oaxaca, where an exhibition of the artist’s work was on display at the Martina Henestrosa Library, which the writer had built in honor of his mother.          Lazo died in Cuernavaca in 2010.          In 1957 she became a founding member of the Instituto Regional de Bellas Artes of Cuernavaca (IRBAC), which supported her work throughout her career. Starting in 1965, she gave classes in painting and origami to children at the institution. Her teaching career extended into kindergarten for much of her career, and from 1975, at the Dirección General de Capacitación y Mejoramiento Profesional del Magisterior, Centro Regional No. 16.          Lazo’s first individual exhibition was at the Trini Gallery in Cuernavaca in 1960. Since then, her work has been exhibited in Mexico, the United States and into South America. Many of her individual exhibitions were in Mexico in venues such as Trini Gallery, Galería 5, Calmecac Gallery, the Salón de la Plástica Morelense, the Palacio de Cortés, the Van Gelder Art Gallery, the Instituto Municipal de Bellas Artes in Cuautla and others. In 1975, a national exhibition of her work was sponsored by the Unión Feminina de Escritoras y Locutoras of Mexico City, for the International Year of the Woman.          In 1968, the Museum of the University of Memphis acquired two of her works, which opened the US market to her.          Lazo’s first recognition was an honorific mention at the V Salón de Pintura at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Later in her life, she received the Quetzalcoatl Prize from a panel that included the news agency Vibraciones de la Ciudad and the Pinacoteca del Reclusorio Oriente. She donated two works to the latter institution. She was also induced into to the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana where she remained active until her death in 2010.","['1940 births', '2010 deaths', 'Mexican women painters', 'Artists from Morelos', 'People from Cuernavaca', '20th-century Mexican painters', '21st-century Mexican painters', '20th-century women artists', '21st-century women artists']"

680483,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680483,REAL Women of Canada,"REAL Women of Canada (""Vraies Femmes du Canada"" in French) is a socially conservative advocacy group in Canada. The organization was founded in 1983.          REAL stands for ""Realistic, Equal, Active, for Life"". The group believes that the nuclear family is the most important unit in Canadian society, and that the fragmentation of the Canadian family is a primary cause of social disorder. It lobbies the Government of Canada in favour of legislation to promote what it believes to be the Judeo-Christian model of family life, and to support homemaking. It is also opposed to feminism, abortion and LGBT rights (and same-sex marriage in Canada as well).          The group has intervened in Supreme Court of Canada cases such as ""R. v. Morgentaler (1993)"" and ""M. v. H."" (1999). In ""R. v. Sullivan"" (1991) it argued that a fetus is a person.          Its objectives are, according to its website:          Part of their economic policies to help meet their objectives are increased tax relief for single-income families, families with children, and individuals with children.          REAL Women is similar in political and social outlook to Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and to Concerned Women for America in the United States.          The organization has also heavily criticized individuals who have spoken out against Uganda's proposed policy of executing gays and lesbians. While they do not explicitly support the execution of homosexuals, they oppose any effort by foreign governments to deter Uganda from implementing the death penalty for LGBT individuals. On August 7, 2013, the group issued a statement criticizing Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird for speaking out on LGBT human rights issues in both Uganda and Russia as part of Canada's foreign policy.          In January 1983, Judy Erola, the federal cabinet minister for the status of women, proposed scrapping the tax exemption for dependent spouses, including mothers at home raising young children. Seeing this change as anti-family and anti-patriarchal, persons active in the anti-abortion campaign began to speak out in opposition. On September 3, 1983, a group of Ontario women formed what would become known as REAL Women: Realistic, Equal, and Active for Life. Although many mainstream feminist organizations were active in the movement for equal rights, REAL Women was dissatisfied with how women's issues were being addressed, and claimed many housewives felt disparaged and attacked by these organizations. REAL Women was formed as an anti-feminist counterweight to the National Action Committee on the Status of Women. A press conference was held in 1984 officially announcing their formation.          The group claimed initially to have 10,000 members, however this was later discredited. The year following their formation, the group held its first national conference, claiming to have 20,000 members, though this could not be verified.          REAL Women claimed to represent a silent majority of women within Canada. They promoted male-led, single-breadwinner families, and believed that women should be homemakers, mothers and wives. Their views and beliefs greatly differed from the stance taken by the National Action Committee on the Status of Women and its umbrella organizations, and REAL Women argued against the equality guarantees already enacted in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 1987 REAL president Lynne Scime stated that ""REAL women want to look at issues such as how a woman can pick a husband to fulfill her needs"". They believed that women are naturally nurturing, emotional and dependent beings, suited to motherhood. They use the slogan ""equal but different"" while pushing for increased tax credits for stay-at-home mothers. The organization denounces the equal rights clause in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and feminist movements and organizations. They argue that government spending and funding of these feminist organizations is undermining traditional gender and family relations. Since the founding of REAL, the movement has made numerous suggestions on how to augment the options and resources available to families.          REAL is directly opposed to issues that organizations such as the National Action Committee advocate and push to enact. One is abortion, which REAL opposes, claiming it is murder. In addition, the group opposes the idea of the universal childcare model, as they believe that governmental childcare represents a loss of parental control and increases the influence of the state on the family. They argue that the funding would be better spent on things such as courses on parenting skills. REAL also oppose laws guaranteeing equal pay for women, believing that this would reduce the income disparity between genders, draw women into the paid labour force, and incentivize the economic position of female-led households. They believe this represents a major threat to family values, demeans women and breaks down the traditional family. They also believe that women taking men's jobs will destroy the free market economy. Other viewpoints they oppose include programs to reduce family violence, which they claim encourage hatred toward men; no-fault divorce; and human rights protections for gays and lesbians. The overarching goal of REAL Women is to support the way of life traditionally associated with the 1950s nuclear family and arch-conservative values. Their belief is that their activism contributes to women's equality and will improve their lives. Their monthly newsletter, ""Real""ity, mirrors the American conservative movement. It regularly attacks feminists such as Flora MacDonald as well as feminist campaigns.","['Pro-life organizations in Canada', 'Christian political organizations', 'Conservatism in Canada', 'Political advocacy groups in Canada', 'Religious organizations based in Canada', ""Women's organizations in Canada"", '1983 establishments in Ontario', ""Women's religious organizations"", 'Organizations established in 1983']"

It saw the final film appearance of actor Joseph Cotten.          A pilot survives the crash of his airplane, unhurt despite all of its 300 passengers dying in the accident. With no memories of the accident, he starts to suffer strange supernatural visions, guiding him to suspect that something happened in the crash and that the accident maybe wasn't an accident.          $350,000 of the budget was invested by the South Australian Film Corporation, with a similar amount coming from English investors. The rest came from Greater Union, a TV sale and private investment.          Prior to filming David Hemmings and Antony I Ginnane discussed whether to make the film gory or more cerebral in the vein of ""The Innocents"" (1961). They chose the latter, a decision Ginnane later said was a mistake.          Ginnane asked Brian Trenchard-Smith to cut a ten-minute trailer to promote the film to potential buyers before it had been finished. This meant he had to shoot some shots of Jenny Agutter. He later cut the trailer for the actual film when it was released.          ""The Survivor"" received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, earning a Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score of 30%, but no official approval rating.          Super Reviewer Alex Roy called the film ""a truly unique horror film that combines elements of supernatural and survival horror into one movie and the result is an interesting concept for a movie that uses an everyday disaster as a basis to start off with the horror.""

Tupua became Leader of the Opposition following his Christian Democratic Party's election defeat in 1982. He also headed the Samoan National Development Party.

8840678,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8840678,Wilhelm Bacher,"Wilhelm Bacher (; , ""Benjamin Ze'ev Bacher""; 12 January 1850 – 25 December 1913) was a Jewish Hungarian scholar, rabbi, Orientalist and linguist, born in Liptó-Szent-Miklós, Hungary to the Hebrew writer Simon Bacher. Wilhelm was himself a prolific writer, authoring or co-authoring approximately 750 works. He was a contributor to many encyclopedias, and was a major contributor to the landmark Jewish Encyclopedia throughout all its 12 volumes . Although almost all of Bacher's works were written in German or Hungarian, at the urging of Hayyim Nahman Bialik many were subsequently translated into Hebrew by Alexander Siskind Rabinovitz.          Wilhelm attended the Hebrew schools in Szucsány and in his native town, and passed through the higher classes of the Evangelical Lyceum at Presburg from 1863 to 1867, at the same time diligently prosecuting Talmudic studies.          In 1867 he began the study of philosophy and of Oriental languages—the latter under Ármin Vámbéry—at the University of Budapest, and also attended the lectures on the Talmud given by Samuel Löb Brill. In 1868, he went to Breslau, where he continued the study of philosophy and philology at the University, and that of theology at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. He graduated at the University of Leipsic in 1870. His graduation thesis, ""Nizâmî's Leben und Werke, und der Zweite Theil des Nizâmî'schen Alexanderbuches,"" appeared in 1871, and was translated into English in 1873 by S. Robinson. This was afterward incorporated in the collection entitled ""Persian Poetry for English Readers."" In 1876, Bacher graduated as rabbi, and shortly afterward was appointed to the rabbinate in Szeged, which had become vacant in consequence of the death of Leopold Löw.          On 1 July 1877, together with Moses Bloch and David Kaufmann, he was appointed by the Hungarian government to the professorship of the newly created Budapest University of Jewish Studies. Bacher delivered the inaugural address in the name of the faculty at the opening of the institution on 4 October 1877 and remained as teacher of the Biblical sciences, of Jewish history, and of various other branches at that institution. Bacher was for a time in 1878 field-chaplain in the Austro-Hungarian army, being delegated to the headquarters of the army of occupation in Bosnia.          The congregation of Pest, Hungary appointed Bacher director of the Talmud-Torah School in 1885. In 1884 Bacher and Joseph Bánóczi founded the Judæo-Hungarian review, the ""Magyar Zsidó Szemle,"" which they conjointly edited during the first seven years. In 1894 he assisted in founding the Judæo-Hungarian Literary Society, Izraelita Magyar Irodami Társulat, of which he became vice-president in 1898. This society instituted a new translation of the Bible into Hungarian—the first complete translation due solely to Jewish initiative. The first five year-books of the society were edited by Bacher in conjunction with F. Mezey and afterward with D. Bánóczi.          Bacher is the author of the following works:          ""Sefer Naḥalat Yehoshua',"" 2 vols., a redaction of the posthumous works of the Talmudist Kosman Wodianer (d. 1830), with a biographical introduction in Hebrew, in connection with which he prepared a list of the correspondents of Moses Sofer, ""Aus der Ersten Hālfte Unseres Jahrhunderts,"" 1893.          Bacher has also been the author of numerous criticisms and reviews in periodicals devoted, like his books, to Hebrew philology, history of Biblical exegesis, and of the Aggadah. The magazines, etc., in which his contributions have appeared are the following:          Further contributions of Bacher appeared in the festival publications to the seventieth birthday of H.

36954390,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36954390,Family of Demetrius II of Georgia,"The family of Demetrius II of Georgia was part of the Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Georgia. Demetrius II (Demetre, or Dimitri; ) was a king of Georgia, reigning from 1270 until his execution by the Mongol Ilkhans in 1289. He was a son of David VII of Georgia by his third wife Gvantsa Kakhaberidze. Demetrius, although a Christian, was polygamous, with three wives, and was survived by nine children, of whom three subsequently ruled as kings of Georgia.          Demetrius, born in 1259, was the second son and third child of King David VII. His mother was David's third wife Gvantsa née Kakhaberidze. He was only 3 or 4 years old when Gvantsa was put to death by the Mongols as a reaction to David's abortive rebellion against the Ilkhan hegemony. David himself died in 1270.          Demetrius had an elder half-brother George, an heir apparent, who died before his father's death in 1268, and an elder half-sister Tamar, whom Demetrius subsequently married off, with great reluctance, to a son of the Mongol official Arghun-Agha. On Arghun's death, Tamar, who despised her marriage, capitalized on her husband's departure from Tbilisi and fled to the mountains of Mtiuleti. She was eventually delivered by Demetrius' powerful minister Sadun Mankaberdeli, a polygamous, who wed her through the intercession of the Ilkhan Abaqa.          The anonymous 14th-century ""Chronicle of a Hundred Years"", part of the Georgian Chronicles, states that Demetrius, previously a pious Christian, allowed himself to come under the influence of the Mongol ""bad habits"". The young king enjoyed, to the dismay of the Georgian catholicos Nicholas III, no less than three wives, his polygamy becoming the occasion of that prelate's abdication in 1282. At the time of Demetrius' death at the hand of the Mongols in 1289, all three of his wives, as well as their children, were alive.          The first of Demetrius' wives was a Trapezuntine princess, whom he married c. 1273–1274 or 1277. Her name and parentage are not recorded in the medieval sources. She might have been a daughter of the emperor Manuel I of Trebizond by his wife Irene Syrikaina, and was probably called Theodora or Irene. In contrast to Demetrius' other wives, she is invariably referred to by the medieval chronicler as ""the queen"", indicating that she enjoyed the status of the king's principal consort. By this woman, Demetrius had four sons, David VIII, Vakhtang III, Lasha, and Manuel, and a daughter named Rusudan. After Demetrius' demise, the Ilkhan Arghun assigned the valley of Skoreti near Tbilisi for the support of the Georgian queen, who kept by her her two young sons, Manuel and Lasha. In 1298, she was part of negotiations with the Mongol general Kutlushah sent by the Ilkhan Arghun against her son David VIII.          Of the children of this marriage, David VIII succeeded his cousin Vakhtang II as king of Georgia in 1292, but continued as a co-king with his younger brother Vakhtang III (r. 1301–1307) and his own son, George VI the Little (r. 1307–1318), until his death in 1310.          Manuel is known from the Georgian annals to have been involved in the mission to Kutlushah in 1298. He was married to Mamkan, a daughter of his tutor Tarsaich Orbelian, Prince of Syunik and Atabag of Georgia, as recorded by Tarsaich's son Stephen in his chronicle. Manuel died in 1314, without known issue.          The only daughter born of Demetrius' first marriage, Rusudan, was married off by his father to a son of his ally, the influential Mongol statesman Buqa. Rusudan appears to have survived the demise of Buqa and his family in 1289, later remarrying Taqa, a Georgian nobleman of the house of Panaskerteli. Rusudan and Taqa are known as benefactors of the Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem. Furthermore, Rusudan is identified with the ""queen of queens Rusudan"" mentioned, along with the late Taqa, in an inscription from the Gudarekhi monastery.          Demetrius' second wife was the Mongol woman Solghar, by whom he had two sons, Baidu and Yadgar, and a daughter, Jigda. Following the death of Demetrius, she retired from Georgia, bringing Baidu and Yadgar with her to her father's home in ""Tartary"". Baidu then reappears in the Georgian annals as an envoy of his half-brother David VIII to the khan of the Golden Horde, Toqta, in 1298. According to one genealogical hypothesis, Jigda is the same as Jiajak, the second wife of the emepror Alexios II of Trebizond.          Demetrius married thirdly, c. 1280, Natela, a daughter of Beka I Jaqeli, Duke of Samtskhe and Lord High Steward of Georgia. After the death of Demetrius, she returned to her father's court, where the only child of Demetrius and Natela, George V, was reared until his appointment as a co-king with his half-brother David VIII in 1299. He became regent for his nephew, George the Little, in 1307, and replaced him as king-regnant in 1318. He was to become the most famous of Demetrius' sons, earning the sobriquet ""the Illustrious"" for the unity and relative prosperity he brought to his country after a century of the Mongol domination.","['Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Georgia', 'Families of Georgia (country)', 'Genealogies of individuals']"

Its signatories included Lord Cornwallis on behalf of the British East India Company, representatives of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Mahratta Empire, and Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore.          The war broke out in late 1789 when Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, attacked Travancore, an ally of the British East India Company. After a little over two years of fighting, forces of the company led by Lord Charles, 2nd Earl Cornwallis, along with allied forces from the Maratha Empire and Hyderabad, laid siege in February 1792 to Mysore's capital, Seringapatam(also called Srirangapatinam). Rather than attempting to storm the works at great cost to all sides, Cornwallis entered into negotiations with Tipu to end the conflict. The resulting treaty was signed on 18 March.          Cornwallis had hoped to use the treaty as a wide-ranging peace settlement that would, in addition to reducing or removing the threat of Mysore, prevent conflict between Hyderabad and the Marathas. The Marathas had, however, resisted inclusion of such language.          Under the terms of the treaty, Mysore ceded about one-half of its territories to the other signatories. The Peshwa acquired territory up to the Tungabhadra River, the Nizam was awarded land from the Krishna to the Penner River, and the forts of Cuddapah and Gandikota on the south bank of the Penner. The East India Company received a large portion of Mysore's Malabar Coast territories between the Kingdom of Travancore and the Kali River, and the Baramahal and Dindigul districts.

Matecumbe consists of two islands (keys,) Upper Matecumbe Key and Lower Matecumbe Key. The latter Key is where the settlement of Matecumbe is located, just south of Matecumbe Bight and adjacent to an just north of Matecumbe Harbor. The southernmost tip of Lower Matecumbe Key marks the beginning of the famed Seven Mile Bridge.          The name Matecumbe refers to a region of area in the Upper Keys. The name Matecumbe is the only place name in South Florida which dates from the sixteenth century and is still used to designate the same or approximate location as at that time. On Spanish maps it is a name which frequently appears, as it did in their records. The exact meaning of the name is unknown, but the suggestion that it was derived from the Spanish mata hombre is a weak one. When the term Matecumbe first appeared in use it was in a form very close to its present spelling and pronunciation. As was often the case in Florida, the name was applied interchangeably to the chief and to the tribe.          This was one of the first of the Upper Keys to be permanently settled. Early homesteaders were so successful at growing pineapples in the rocky soil that at one time the island yielded the country's largest annual crop. However, foreign competition and the Hurricane of 1935 killed the industry. Today, life centers on fishing and tourism, and the island is filled with bait shops, marinas, and charter-fishing boats.          Pulitzer Prize-winning author James A. Michener was in his sixties when he began traveling frequently to the Florida Keys.

18056083,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18056083,New England New State Movement,"The New England New State Movement was an Australian political movement in the twentieth century. Originally called the Northern Separation Movement, the aim of the movement was to seek the secession of the New England region and surrounding areas from the State of New South Wales (NSW) and the establishment of a new State of New England. While initially popular and the subject of two Royal Commissions, the movement was ultimately unsuccessful, following defeat at a referendum in 1967.          Because New England has never had a formal identity, its claimed boundaries have varied with time. In broad terms, it covers the humid coastal strip including the Hunter Region to the Queensland border, the New England Tablelands and the immediately adjoining Western Slopes and Plains.          In economic and geographic terms, New England forms a natural unit that has survived to the present day.          In political terms, the boundaries have varied. The initial separation discussions excluded the Hunter, in part because of tensions between the industrial and mining heartland of the lower Hunter and the rest of the area. This created a problem because an urban/industrial centre like Newcastle and the Hunter were seen as an essential part of New England, or any new state, in economic and geographic terms. The boundaries recommended by the 1935 report of the Nicholas Royal Commission into areas of NSW suitable for self-government included Newcastle and the Hunter. These boundaries were adopted by the New England New State Movement and used as the basis for the 1967 self-government referendum.          New England was initially called Northern NSW, the North, the Northern Districts or the Northern Provinces. The name New England was originally the name of the Tableland area forming New England's core. The Tablelands are known as the Northern Tablelands, the New New England Tablelands or sometimes just the New England to distinguish them from the broader New England area.          The name New England was adopted for the whole area by the Northern Separation Movement at its 1931 Maitland convention. From there its usage spread, contracting again as the new state movement went into decline after 1967.          The first separatist agitation occurred during colonial times at the time of the separation of Queensland from NSW. While this was followed by outbreaks of agitation, these remained sporadic.          This changed in the twentieth century. Agitation began again at Grafton towards the end of the First World War led by Earle Page, a local doctor and later a prominent politician, rising to caretaker Prime Minister of Australia. This was picked up a little later by Victor Thompson, editor of the Tamworth ""Northern Daily Leader"" who launched a sustained newspaper campaign that involved papers as far south as Cessnock in the lower Hunter. This led to the creation of a formal movement. In 1922 a formal request to the Commonwealth was made by the lower house to establish a new state in northern New South Wales. One outcome was the 1924 Cohen Royal Commission into New States.          The Cohen Commission ruled against to the movement and it went into decline, resurging at the start of the Great Depression. This forced another Royal Commission, the Nicholas Commission. While this recommended in favour, the movement was again in decline as economic conditions improved.          Agitation started again at the end of the Second World War and this time was sustained by permanent staff. In 1953, 21 councils defied the state government and held unofficial referendum on the issue of a new state. The people voted overwhelmingly in favor of the referendum. In 1961 the movement launched Operation Seventh State, raising over AU₤100,000. This allowed more staff and greater agitation.          This acceptance of boundaries determined by the Nicholas Commission proved to be the movement's critical strategic error. It assumed that a state was not viable unless it was dominated by a large urban population on the English/London model. Yet, the evidence from similar federations like Canada and the USA revealed numerous successful ""farm states"", like Wyoming, Montana and the Dakotas, with comparatively small capital city populations tied to a single, essentially rural community of interest. This metrocentric mindset ensured that two quite distinct communities of interest were being pressured into a doomed arranged marriage. It was also the very antithesis of an ""act of free choice"" as that choice involved imposing a majority rural will over a geographically distinct urban community. A new state proposal based in most part on boundaries formed by those Local Councils with majorities that actually wanted the change would have acquired a critical momentum.          Premier Robert Askin and the Cabinet believed in 1966 that a secession referendum would win, so they had the upper Hunter Region and Newcastle included within the boundaries of the proposed new state before putting it to a vote.          A referendum of New England electors was held on 29 April 1967. The no vote was led by the Australian Labor Party who campaigned hard. The referendum was narrowly defeated with 54% voting no.          Despite this defeat, four New State candidates stood for election at the 1968 state election and gained 0.80% of the total state vote with Garry Nehl, in the seat of Clarence, winning 35% of the primary vote. However this was a brief twilight in the campaign and, exhausted, the movement again went into decline for the next four decades.          The movement underwent a resurgence in 2004, primarily in response to State (Labor) Government shire amalgamations and farmers responses to new vegetation management policies. The Annual General Meetings of NSW Farmers passed resolutions to investigate the feasibility of a non-metropolitan state in both 2004 and 2005. A task force was formed chaired by then NSWF President Mr Malcolm Peters. Some polling was commissioned and a convention was held but little further effort appears to have taken place.          A group of dedicated activists continue to agitate for a new state in the area. Presently this is carried out in an informal sense or through social media such as a dedicated Facebook page.","['New England (New South Wales)', 'Proposed states and territories of Australia', 'History of New South Wales', '20th century in New South Wales']"
1502108,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1502108,Three Bishoprics,"The Three Bishoprics (, ) constituted a province of pre-revolutionary France consisting of the dioceses of Metz, Verdun, and Toul within the Lorraine region. The three dioceses were Prince-bishoprics of the Holy Roman Empire until they were seized by King Henry II of France between April and June 1552. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, they were officially ceded to France by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.          In the course of the rebellion against the Habsburg emperor Charles V, several Protestant Imperial princes met at Lochau Castle near Torgau in May 1551. Here the receiving Wettin elector Maurice of Saxony forged an alliance with Duke John Albert I of Mecklenburg, Prince William IV of Hesse, whose father Landgrave Philip I was jailed by the emperor, the Hohenzollern margrave Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and his cousin Duke Albert of Prussia.           Dissatisfied with the Interim decreed by Charles V at the 1548 Diet of Augsburg, the insurgents were full of resolution to defend Protestantism and–not least–their autonomy against the Imperial central authority. They agreed to establish contacts with the Catholic French king Henry II, disregarding his oppression of the Protestant Huguenots. In autumn Henry declared war against Charles V and prepared to march against the Empire up to the Rhine River. On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord with Maurice of Saxony and his Protestant allies, whereby the French conquests were legitimised ahead of time. The princes acknowledged the king's lordship as ""Vicar of the Empire"" over the Imperial cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun, as well as Cambrai ""and other towns of the Empire that do not speak German"". The insurgents in turn received subsidies and military assistance from the French, their troops moved into the Habsburg hereditary lands and laid siege to the emperor at Innsbruck, while his brother Ferdinand I entered into negotiations that led to the revocation of the Augsburg Interim by the 1552 Peace of Passau.          Backed by Duke Francis of Guise and his brother Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, King Henry II of France upon his agreement with the Protestant princes had started his ""Voyage d’Allemagne"" ""for the sake of German liberties"". On Palm Sunday 1552 French troops under the command of Anne de Montmorency in a surprise attack moved into the walls of Metz, followed by the occupation of Toul on 13 April. Henry then turned against the Lorraine capital Nancy, where he had the minor duke Charles III abducted to the French court in Paris. On 18 April the king celebrated his entry into Metz and, after a failed attack on the Imperial City of Strasbourg, returned from the Rhine to move into Verdun on 12 June. At that time, the French had occupied the three Imperial cities as well as the territory of the surrounding Prince-bishoprics.          As from the emperor's perspective, Elector Maurice and his allies had no right to legally dispose of Imperial territory, Charles V started a campaign against the French in order to reconquer the occupied dioceses culminating in the Siege of Metz from 19 October 1552 to 2 January 1553. The expedition ultimately failed, when the Imperial troops were defeated by the French forces under Duke Francis of Guise in the 1554 Battle of Renty. When the emperor, worn out and exhausted, abdicated in 1556, his successor Ferdinand I discontinued all attempts to regain the Three Bishoprics.           King Henry II left a permanent garrison in each of the cities and gradually subjected its citizens to his royal authority. Especially the Metz townsmen filed several petitions to the Imperial Diet, however, the retrieval of the lost Three Bishoprics was no longer a main concern of the disintegrating Empire during the ongoing confessionalization. Initiated by Cardinal Richelieu, the ""Trois-Évêchés"" received a certain autonomy with a provincial parlement installed in 1633 in Metz, dominated by the city's patriciate. Civil commotions decreased as the cities prospered under French rule, though the implementation of the gabelle of salt sparked some unrest in Metz. When King Louis XIV acceded to the throne in 1643, he confirmed the privileges of the Metz, Toul and Verdun citizens as his ""good and faithful subjects"".          After the acquisition of the Three Bishoprics was finally recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the province's territory was further enlarged by parts of the Duchy of Luxembourg around Thionville (""Diedenhofen""), ceded to France according to the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees, and several Lorraine villages annexed in 1661.           The Diocese of Saint-Dié, created in 1777 and sometimes called the ""Fourth Bishopric of Lorraine"" (« ""le Quatrième Évêché lorrain"" »), is not related historically to the Three Bisphoprics.",['Former provinces of France']

Stanton argued that because the income tax contained no provision for depletion of a mine's ore, it was a direct tax on the mine's capital.

Stanton appealed from the district court's denial of the injunction.          The U.S. Supreme Court noted that the case ""was commenced by the appellant [John R. Stanton] as a stockholder of the Baltic Mining Company, the appellee, to enjoin the voluntary payment by the corporation and its officers of the tax assessed against it under the income tax section of the tariff act of October 3, 1913."" On a direct appeal from the trial court, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, and rejected Stanton's request for a court order to prevent Baltic Mining Company from paying the income tax.          Stanton argued that the tax law was unconstitutional and void under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that the law denied ""to mining companies and their stockholders equal protection of the laws and deprive[d] them of their property without due process of law."" The Supreme Court rejected that argument.          Stanton also argued that the Sixteenth Amendment ""authorizes only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform"" and that therefore the income tax was ""not within the authority of that Amendment."" The Court also rejected this argument and upheld the constitutionality of the income tax under the 1913 Revenue Act.","['United States Supreme Court cases', '1916 in United States case law', 'United States Supreme Court cases of the White Court']"

39191072,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39191072,Bisexual politics,"Bisexual politics refer to arguments that surround individuals that identify as bisexual and their perspectives on issues involving sexuality, equality, visibility and inclusion. Some authors describe ""bisexual politics"" as a form of identity politics.          One form of activism within ""bisexual politics"" includes the addition of the word ""bisexual"" onto lesbian and gay organisations (such as the acronym LGB) and fighting employment discrimination for bisexual individuals. However, the political issues as well as the position of bisexuals on these issues are considerably more complex.          New York University School of Law professor Kenji Yoshino says:          Gays de-legitimatize bisexuals [...] the lesbian and gay community abounds with negative images of bisexuals as fence-sitters, traitors, cop-outs, closet cases, people whose primary goal in life is to retain 'heterosexual privilege'.          There is an underlying fear that including bisexuals as members in gay rights movements may hurt the movement, either because it is believed that bisexuals ""enjoy heterosexual privilege"", that they had less to lose than lesbian or gay men, or because their presence lessens the solidarity among gay and lesbian groups in some way. Rather than fence sitters, bisexuals are at further risk for marginalization because they can be ostracized by both straight and gay communities. Writers on bisexuality recognize this danger however, as sociologist Amanda Udis-Kessler, puts it, ""We are not fence-sitters. Let us strive to be bridge-builders"". These concerns are recognized by Lisa Orlando author of ""Loving whom we choose"", who writes:          We challenge many people's personal sense of what constitutes sexual identity. Whether we threaten by introducing a third category or by undermining the notion of categories altogether, we cause enough discomfort that many people deny our existence.          Thus, bisexual politics involve, among other issues, the debate over inclusion in both gay and straight movements and cultures.          The problem of identity centers upon whether bisexuals build an identity around their bisexuality and, what being a bisexual means socially and how it relates to other identities such as feminism. One debate is whether or not it is valuable to establish bisexuality as a sexual identity. As author Jennifer Baumgardner writes:          It is feminist to understand bisexuality as its own identity too, because it's a chapter of women's history that has been repressed and misunderstood, and one that has contributed substantially to current ideas about queerness           However the author recognizes that there are also political limitations to identifying as bisexual, saying that:          The thing about being bisexual is that you don't really have to be out in the same ways. You can often pass for straight. This can be a weak position politically – how can we organize people around gay rights if we don't identify, and can't be identified by others, as gay?           Out of this debate, a variety of identity terms have expanded to include the many ideas surrounding this complex issue of identity and sexuality including, ""pansexuality"" (""omnisexuality""), ""polysexuality"", and just ""being sexual"".          Among some critics, a belief is held that bisexual politics is important to equal rights on the basis of ""entitlement"". The term ""entitlement"" here refers specifically to the belief that a bisexual can be and are viewed as straight in some public spheres and thus enjoy the benefits of equality that come along with ""assumed heterosexuality."" Baumgardner recognizes this view and writes:          Bisexuality [...] contains the liberating potential of aligning with a disparaged (gay and lesbian) group but not being relegated – at least not full-time – to the ghetto. This is the political value of what is called, negatively, entitlement. The political weakness of entitlement (lack of consciousness) have been overstated – as with young feminists – and its potential for change has been neglected [...] Perhaps we need those bridging people on the side of privilege willing to connect the gay and straight worlds- in order to get more done [...] It takes someone who has known relative freedom, who expects it and loves it, to help ignite social change          Bisexual politics also involves the arguments surrounding how visible a minority of bisexuals are in society, and how this interacts bisexual activism. It has been said that bisexuals can identify between groups at different times. For example the question, ""When a female bisexual is in a relationship with a man does she cease to become bisexual and alternatively heterosexual?"" and also, ""When the bisexual female abandons her male partner for a female one, can that individual identify as homosexual?"" This belief can lead to issues of visibility in that, a bisexual person may identify with either sexual orientation or alternatively, with neither. Another aspect of this debate is whether bisexuals should operate as visible minorities distinct from homosexuals. As Lani Kaahumanu writes, ""So, why does the attitude exist that there is no bisexual community, and why has it been used against us so effectively? Why have we 'accepted' invisibility, and why haven't we, up to this point, projected a more visible presence, creating a more prominent community that even the most virulent biphobes would have to recognize?""          Inclusion is a main issue with regard to bisexual politics as this group is at risk of being viewed as homosexual by heterosexual groups, and also as ""traitors"" or closeted by the gay and lesbian communities. Lesbian and gay organizations all over the country hotly debate whether or not to include bisexuals in programming and names of groups and events. Author Naiomi Tucker argues:          Bisexuality can be a unifying force in the world. But we must avoid the mistakes of some of our lesbian sisters who profess sexual acceptance [...] [while they] invalidate bisexuality as an orientation [...] If we claim self-definition for ourselves, then we must accord that right to others [...] As a bisexual movement we can create a community where it is safe for everyone to comfortably express their sexuality. As well, a quote from collection of bisexual testimonials puts the issue poignantly ""I very much resented the smugness of lesbians who said my evolution was incomplete [...] Although I understand sexual politics, I could no sooner change my sexual orientation, nor would I want to, any more than a lesbian could.          Inclusion continues to be an issue in bisexual politics, and specifically whether bisexuals represent an additional minority or rather a merging of opposing heterosexual and homosexual groups. Thus bisexual politics considers how bisexuals may offer a bridge by which individuals can reconcile differences and be a positive force in human rights.","['Bisexuality', 'Politics by issue', 'Identity politics', 'LGBT politics']"

527734,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=527734,Dafydd Iwan,"Dafydd Iwan (born 24 August 1943), is a Welsh folk singer and politician. He was the president of Plaid Cymru (2003-2010).          Dafydd Iwan Jones was born in Brynaman in Carmarthenshire, Wales, and is the elder brother of politician Alun Ffred Jones. His paternal grandfather, Fred Jones, was a founding member of Plaid Cymru. He spent most of his youth in Bala in Gwynedd before attending the University of Wales, Cardiff where he studied architecture. He rose to fame as a singer-songwriter, writing and playing folk music in the Welsh language.          Iwan's earliest material was Welsh translations of songs by American folk/protest singers: Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Bob Dylan until he began to write his first ballads. The most prominent of these were political including the satirical song, ""Carlo"" (""Charlie""). This was written for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. Iwan has also written love ballads and variations on traditional Welsh folk tunes.          By the late 1960s he was receiving television coverage both for his music and for his political activities, including being imprisoned in 1970 as part of the fight for Welsh language rights, an event commemorated in his song ""Pam fod eira'n wyn?"" (""Why is snow white?"").          During the 1970s, Dafydd Iwan's political interests (and songs) took in such themes as Pinochet's Chile; Welsh Devolution; the Vietnam War and the Northern Ireland troubles. His inherent internationalism continued in following decades, as his songs mention events such as the Tiananmen Square massacre (1989), the Gulf War (1990) and opencast mining in the south Wales valleys (1995). His biggest hit, ""Yma O Hyd"" (""Still Here""), released in 1981, has become a favourite of most Welsh folk music fans          In 1982 and 1983, Dafydd Iwan embarked on two tours (and accompanying records) with the folk group Ar Log. The standard of Ar Log's musicianship raised Dafydd Iwan's own performance. Indeed, it was the success of Ar Log which persuaded Dafydd Iwan to continue entertaining at small venues throughout Wales.          Around the turn of the millennium, Dafydd Iwan signalled an end to regular performances, although he remains an occasional performer on an ad hoc basis. It was fitting by many fans that the end of his career should coincide roughly with the establishment of an elected National Assembly for Wales and the beginning of a new generation in Welsh politics.          Dafydd Iwan was one of the founders of Recordiau Sain Cyf (Sain Records Ltd), one of the main Welsh music labels, a business he still manages today.          Formerly a Plaid Cymru councillor in Gwynedd he lost his seat in the May 2008 local elections. He blamed his defeat on a dirty tricks campaign by his opponents.          Iwan's long service to the Welsh language led to his being made an honorary member of the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod at Bangor in 1971.          Iwan escaped a driving ban (for speeding offences) in October 2003 on the basis that he needed to drive for his musical and political duties. This incident led the satirical ""Private Eye"" magazine to question ""Is Plaid Cymru a political party or a racing team?""          Iwan became President of Plaid Cymru in 2003. He is regarded as a unifying force within the party in the context of several damaging internal splits in recent years.          As part of his campaign seeking re-election as President of Plaid Cymru, Iwan launched a campaign blog 'Dafydd 4 President' in July 2008.          On 22 October 2011, Dafydd and his wife Bethan came to watch the Welsh derby, Wrexham FC vs Newport County AFC. Dafydd sang his hit song 'Yma O Hyd' in front of a crowd of 4,000 before the teams came out. He was invited to sing by the new Wrexham FC Supporters Group named 'Yma O Hyd' named after his song.","['1943 births', 'Leaders of Plaid Cymru', 'Living people', 'Singers from Carmarthenshire', 'Welsh folk musicians', 'Welsh singer-songwriters', 'Welsh-language music', 'Welsh-language activists', 'Welsh-speaking politicians', 'Councillors in Wales', 'Alumni of the Welsh School of Architecture']"
7747306,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7747306,Parc Jean-Drapeau,"Parc Jean-Drapeau (formerly called Parc des Îles) is situated to the east of downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in the Saint Lawrence River. It comprises two islands, Saint Helen's Island and the artificial island Notre Dame Island.          The islands were the site of the Expo 67 World's Fair. Notre Dame Island was constructed for the exposition. The park was renamed in honour of Jean Drapeau, the late mayor of Montreal and initiator of Expo 67.          Saint Helen's Island was discovered by French explorer Samuel de Champlain in 1611, who named it in honour of his wife, Hélène de Champlain, née Boullé. It also bears the name of Helena, mother of Roman emperor Constantine the Great.          The island belonged to the family of Le Moyne de Longueuil from 1665 until 1818, when it was sold to the British government. The British built a fort, a magazine and a bunker after the War of 1812. The new Canadian government acquired it in 1870, and it was converted into a park in 1874.          The islands of the archipelago were chosen as the site of Man and His World (Expo 67). To prepare for this role, Mayor Jean Drapeau expanded Saint Helen's Island and consolidated it with several neighboring islands (including Round Island) and created Notre Dame Island using the fill excavated during the construction of the Montreal Metro in the early 1960s. 28 million tons of fill were needed for this massive undertaking. When the work was completed, Notre-Dame Island and St. Helen's Island hosted Expo 67, which featured pavilions from over sixty countries.          After the closing of Expo, the site continued its fair vocation under the name Man and His World and finally, most facilities were dismantled and the island was converted into a park. In 1999, the Parc des Îles de Montreal was renamed Parc Jean-Drapeau in honour of former Mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau, who had re-shaped the islands, built the Montreal Metro and brought Expo 67 to the city.          –Summer is the high season for the park, as the majority of attractions are open to the public. These include:           –An amusement park, La Ronde operated by Six Flags under an emphyteutic lease          –The Casino de Montréal          –An environmental museum at the Montreal Biosphere (United States pavilion during Expo 67)          –The early Victorian Era fortifications at Fort de l'Île Sainte-Hélène, which includes the Stewart Museum          –A Formula-1 race track, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which hosts the Canadian Grand Prix          –The city's largest outdoor concert venue, regularly hosting the Vans Warped Tour, Osheaga Festival and Heavy MTL, and as of 2014, an EDM festival known as île Soniq          –An Olympic rowing basin          –An aquatics centre          –A beach          During winter for several weekends, the park throws the winter carnival Fête des neiges de Montréal which is a free event that offers a variety of winter activities.          The islands also boast numerous hiking and skiing trails, bike paths, large athletic grounds and diverse other services and conveniences. During the more temperate months, a diverse array of free and pay activities are offered on a weekly basis in addition to the aforementioned attractions. There's also a weekly electronic dance festival located under Alexander Calder's sculpture Man, commissioned for Expo 67.          The islands are also notable for the remnants of Expo 67, most of which are still in use, though few are still standing. The American and French pavilions are the best preserved, functioning today as the Biosphere and Casino respectively. The Canadian pavilion contains administrative offices, rental halls, and is the site of the studio of Radio-Classique Montréal. The former Tunisian and Jamaican pavilions are also in use, the former for bike rentals while the latter is used principally for receptions.           A considerable portion of Ile Notre Dame was redeveloped into an intricate and elaborate flower garden in the early 1980s, which remains today. The only other significant remnant of the former World's Fair is the Place des Nations at the western end of Ile Sainte Helene, though this is abandoned and officially off limits. As such, it's become a popular spot for fishing.          A snowboarding park was added in winter 2009.","['Parc Jean-Drapeau', 'Parks in Montreal', 'Music venues in Montreal', 'Expo 67']"
9170817,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9170817,Tommy Storm,"Tommy Storm is the first novel by Irish author A.J. Healy. The protagonist is Tommy Storm, a boy, aged 11½, who experiences friendship and a love for his planet only when he is sent far away from Earth with four other Earth kids, to a school of sorts on the far side of the Milky Way, populated by ""aliens"". The year is 2096—a time when it is always 34˚C, birds are extinct and it's raining at all times everywhere on Earth due to ""The Great Climate Enhancement"". Only the very tops of mountains protrude above sea-level and everyone lives in floating cities.          The book follows Tommy's first adventure. A sequel, Tommy Storm and the Galactic Knights, was released in Ireland on 24 September 2009, with more to come.          Declan Kiberd, one of Ireland's foremost literary critics has said of ""Tommy Storm"": ""Brilliant. Hilarious. An intergalactic Gulliver's Travels.”          In December 2006, Tony Hickey said in ""Village"" magazine: “""Tommy Storm"" is a knockout achievement that succeeds on so many levels and satirises so many cultural and literary genres that, to me, it reads as if Flann O'Brien had taken to writing science-fiction.""          Earth's President (Guttly Randolph) and the Grand Council receive an invitation from the MilkyFed, a federation in the centre of the Milky Way. They want 5 Earth children (of the Grand Council's choice) to come across space to a training centre. The training will prepare the participants for a dangerous and secret mission. Elsorr Maudlin, Earth's Deputy President, believes the MilkyFed are up to no good, so he threatens to delay the decision until after the deadline. He agrees not to delay it on two conditions. One, he can choose the Grand Council Elder to accompany the Five children. Second, he can choose one of the five children. For his first condition, Maudlin chooses Randolph, so he can be the President, in full power. For his second condition, he chooses a boy who is thought by all a loser. The boy's name is Tommy Storm.          Meanwhile, at The Wilchester Academy for Younger Adults, Tommy Storm, a boy of 11, is being bullied by a stronger, more popular boy named Felkor Stagwitch. In self-defence, Tommy ends up being grounded to his room. Later, Mr Withers, the headmaster, announces that Felkor Stagwitch is going on to a training school far away in the centre of the Milky Way. Afterwards, in Tommy's room, Mr Withers tells Tommy privately that he was also chosen.          After some tests, the Earthlings are ranked from 1 to 5, Felkor first, Tommy last. According to their rank, they're put in groups of 5 with other species from other planets.          During his time at the training school, Tommy Storm encounters many new things, and learns the history of his life.          -The 25 students at the training school soon learn they are here because the Milki Masters know of an appending apocalype – the end of the universe, referring to the apocalypse only as the TFC (Terrible Future Calamity). At the end of the training schools period, one of the groups will be chosen to go on a mission to find out what will cause the TFC, and try to stop it. In order to win, the group must win competitions in different categories to earn points.          -Each time he meets one of the Milki Masters, they seem to recognise something about him. At the end of his stay, Lord Beardedmoustachedwiseface-oh (the leader of the Milki Masters) reveals that Tommy's parents had been abducted by the Milki Masters long ago because Lord Beardedmoustachedwiseface-oh had found out about a meteor heading towards Earth – one so big, it was set to destroy Earth. One of the Milki Masters then fires another meteor at the meteor going to Earth to try and destroy it. She misses and Earth is destroyed. Tommy's parents (who had said they're name's were Bonny and Clive) then allowed themselves to die so they could turn back time. A different Milki Master takes the shot this time – and hits. Each Milki Master had recognised him because he looks so like his parents.          -The winning group will be sent to learn about the TFC on a spaceship known as Swiggy. To get going Swiggy must leave the runway at SickoWarpo Speed (faster than the speed of light). They only have enough room for three courses – each course must go through a planet and destroy it. Earth is one of the planets that could be destroyed. Eventually, Earth is chosen to be obliterated.          -One Milki Master brings Tommy and his group to an abyss. A plank of wood is attached to the side of the abyss, like a divingboard. The Milki Master tells them that it takes eight steps to walk the plank, and for every step you take, you will see something different in the Abyss. He tells them of a legend – if you come to the end of the plank, turn around, cross your arms and fall in to the abyss, someone who loves you will catch you and bring you back to the top. He also tells them that no one has taken more than four steps. They each try to walk the plank, until they are interrupted by another group's arrival, just as Tommy is about to take a fifth step. Tommy returns one night to try to walk the plank again. As he enters, two of his group follow. Tommy doesn't notice them, and locks the door behind him. The room is soundproof, so he doesn't hear them banging on the door. Tommy walks the plank, each step seeing terrible things – such as Earth burning along with its people. Finally, he takes his eighth step, turns around, crosses his arms, and falls back. Nobody knows exactly what he saw or did in the abyss, but it is believed his parents caught him, and talked to him, and adored him until he returns to the top.          -Meanwhile, on Earth, Elsorr Maudlin is abusing his power as president. He killed two Grand Council members, and sent one to a prison. When Guttly Randolph has a heart attack and dies, Tommy brings him to Earth to be buried. Maudlin forces him to bring the coffin – with Randolph inside – to the Grand Council. While Maudlin is extremely happy that he is dead, Randolph stands up. It is revealed that MilkyFed doctors are far more advanced, and were able to bring him back to life – thought they cannot do that to people who are really dead. Randolph pretended to be dead to get to the Grand Council. Maudlin stabs Randolph with his sword. Tommy draws his own sword and they fight. Just as Maudlin overpowers Tommy, Randolph brings an elevator shaft down on top of him, killing him. Randolph then dies from the stab wound, even though he could have been saved by the MilkyFed doctors, stating he is ready to be with Gerty (his late wife).          -Upon returning to the training school, Tommy learns of the final score of points between the groups – Felkor's group first and his group last, although his group should have been first. Lord Beardedmoustachedwise-face-oh announces that someone in Tommy's group did something against the rules (Tommy knows that he is the person, and the rule he broke was getting up at night, and entering the abyss), so his group is disqualified from the competitions after he broke the rules. Medals are awarded to the other 4 groups (surprisingly, the same medal is given to each person in every group). Lord Beardedmoustachedwiseface-oh then tells his favourite poem;          ""'Tis not what you do, 'tis how you do it. 'Tis not what you say, 'tis how you say it. First shall be last, gibbledibble-blast.""          He then announces that Tommy's group has won, regardless of points. Tommy's group then boards Swiggy. When they have left, it is revealed that the Milki Masters have no clue about the TFC.          Swiggy approaches Earth, faster than the speed of light. When they collide, it seems they are in darkness for a long time. Then everything returns. But, as one of the group notices, Earth is still there. Tommy then reveals how he stole two wigholes from the training school and placed them on either side of Earth, in perfect rotation so that when Swiggy almost collided with Earth, it really entered a wighole.          Rumbles and Woozie decide to try out an old legend. It was believed by MilkyFed folk that if a person crossed their arms, closed their eyes, and fell backwards without bending their legs, someone who loves them would catch them. This was known as the ""Inner-Lath Catch"". Rumbles and Woozie cannot do this without bending their legs, and so it doesn't work. They give up when Rumbles knocks open a cabinet, covering him/her in Grow-sss-goo. Marielle watches them try after her bath. She then decides to try it herself. The book ends, saying she managed not to bend her legs.          ""Tommy Storm"" has received mixed reviews.          ""Inis"" Magazine described it as ""truly entertaining; funny, gripping, imaginative, full of suspense, strong characters and utter wackiness!"" while ""The Telegraph"" called it ""a sort of sci-fi Harry Potter"" and went on ""but the clutter of silly names (Lady MuckBeff, FroydyAnn), typographical tricks, barmy footnotes and laboured jokes leads to tedium.""           Tony Hickey for ""Village Magazine"" (December 2006) wrote """"Tommy Storm"" is a knockout achievement that succeeds on so many levels and satirises so many cultural and literary genres that, to me, it reads as if Flann O'Brien had taken to writing science-fiction.          AJ Healy has given us a tale laced with verbal elegance that, as in all good satire, causes us to swallow the sugar-coated pill before we know what's happening. And the satire starts with the blurb on the front cover: ""Winner of the 'My-Book-is-Better-Than-Your-Book' Piffle Prize (2097)"".          There are jokes and laughs on every page. The book succeeds brilliantly on many levels. Sci-fi fans with a sense of humour will particularly love it, as will readers who endorse the notion that uncomplicated narrative is just not enough for many young people. Agile minds need agile challenges.""          A wighole is the size and shape of a pizza. Every wighole is part of a pair. If a person or thing enters a wighole, he/she/it will come out of the other wighole in the pair. Wigholes are close cousins with wormholes.          Tommy's group is last out of the five groups. His group consists of himself, Woozie Wibblewoodrow, Marielle, Sum-Wun-Saurus (dubbed Summy) and Rumblethunderbumbles (dubbed Rumbles). Woozie is a wibblewallian, small, round, furry creature from the planet Friggle. He is the first to meet Tommy in the training school, and they become good friends. Woozie was chosen from his planet because he is the best on the entire planet at floating bowling. Marielle is an elquinine from planet Wild-Elqui-9. She looks very human. Marielle is short for her full title: Most-Awesomely-Radiant-ickle-Elegant-Lusciously-Laughterful-Empress. Elquinines can breathe underwater. Tommy has a crush on her, and in ""The Galactic Knights"", it is revealed that Marielle had a crush on him, but it is unknown whether she still does or not. Summy is a dragon-like female dinosaurus from the planet Uh-oh-Ithinktheysaurus. Rumbles is a thunderbumble from the planet Shaggyfurmop. Thunderbumbles are both male and female. He/she has three hands and looks similar to a bear.          All people in the universe have three fingers and a thumb on both hands, except Humans. They also have four toes, unlike humans. Humans have been majorly uninvolved in anything except what is happening on Earth. But all others in the universe are more advanced, and his roommates have to explain the things that are new to him, but normal for them.          The training school that Tommy and the other 24 kids go to is in IGGY (InterGalactic Great Youth space station), in the centre of the Milky Way. The Milki Masters are Lord Bearedmoustachedwiseface-oh, Miss LeWren, Mr Crabble, Mr Monsenior and Lady Muckbeff. They must compete in sports, quizzes and tournaments to gain points to be selected for the dangerous mission. These include MilkyWay History and Geography, P.O.O., phenomena, floating bowling, Planet Chessy, jegg race and flashscimitar contest.          In 2002, A.J. Healy finished Tommy Storm, but publishers turned down the book, mainly because Healy is unknown. Four years later, in 2006, he self-published 5,000 copies. Because Healy had such low funding, the sales needed word-of-mouth for books to be sold. After 3,000 copies of the book were sold, Quercus, a UK publisher, bought the rights to republish Tommy Storm. And so, in March 2008, Tommy Storm was relaunched.

38948873,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38948873,Kachalsky v. Cacace,"Kachalsky v. Cacace (District - 10 Civ 05413, 2nd Circuit - 11-3642) is a case regarding the constitutionality of ""may-issue"" concealed carry laws. The plaintiffs, Alan Kachalsky, Christina Nikolov, and the Second Amendment Foundation, represented by Alan Gura, originally sought an injunction barring Susan Cacace, handgun licensing authority for co-Defendant Westchester County, New York, from enforcing a requirement of New York State law that applicants for handgun carry permits demonstrate ""proper cause"" for the issuance of a handgun license and subsequent carry of a handgun in public.          The case is a direct challenge to the State of New York's ""may-issue"" system of concealed carry firearm licensing as being an unconstitutional infringement of the right to keep and bear arms as recognized by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It is similar in basic subject matter to several other cases, such as ""Woollard v. Sheridan"" and ""Moore v. Madigan"", filed in the wake of the landmark Supreme Court decision in ""McDonald v. Chicago"" which applied the Second Amendment as a check on State power as well as Federal, under the selective incorporation doctrine.          Chapter 265 of the Penal Code of the State of New York deals primarily with crimes involving illegal possession of firearms. §265.01(1) generally prohibits the possession of firearms by individuals, making it a gross misdemeanor, while §265.03(3) makes possession of a firearm outside of one's home or place of business a felony. However, these do not apply, as in 265.20, to an individual who possesses a license issued by the State of New York under Chapter 400 of the Penal Code. The only license available to most residents of the State is provided under §400.00(2), which is a license ""to have and carry concealed, without regard to employment or place of possession, [a pistol or revolver] by any person when proper cause exists for the issuance thereof."" Self-Defense is described as a ""central component"" of the 2nd Amendment, see, McDonald vs. City of Chicago (2010), and New York is ignoring this as ""proper cause"" to deny this right to keep and bear arms for self-defense. This ""proper cause"" clause is understood to allow the issuing authority discretion to deny permits based on lack of demonstration by the applicant of such cause.          Alan Kachalsky applied for such a carry license in 2008, and was denied by Cacace on the recommendation of the County Judge in October, based solely on the fact that he ""has not stated any facts which would demonstrate a need for self protection distinguishable from that of the general public."" (The county judge who made this recommendation is not named specifically in the suit; this is common as lawsuits claiming damages resulting from judicial orders have a very high burden of proof to prevent retaliatory litigation). He appealed to the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court, which in September 2009 held that the Defendants' decision was not ""arbitrary or capricious"" and would stand. The New York State Court of Appeals dismissed a further appeal in February 2010 on the grounds that it presented no constitutional question. At the time, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had held that the decisions made in ""District of Columbia v. Heller"" did not apply to the States as the Second Amendment had not been incorporated to the States. However, in June 2010, the Supreme Court's decision in ""McDonald"" overturned this decision and held that the Second Amendment did constitute a limitation on States' powers.          Plaintiff Christina Nikolov similarly applied for a handgun carry license in the same County in 2009, and was denied for similar reasons, including a similar finding that Nikolov ""has not demonstrated that she has a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general public."" It should be Noted: ""A State cannot impose a license, Tax, or fee on a Constitutionally protected Right,"" see, Murdock vs. Penn 319 US 105 (1942); further, ""The U.S. Supreme Court HELD that licensing and registration of ANY Constitutional Right is itself unconstitutional,"" see, 321 U.S. 573 (1944). ""All Laws that are repugnant to the U.S. Constitution are NULL and VOID,"" see, Maybury vs. Madison (1803).          The federal complaint, dated July 14, 2010, was filed in the District Court for the Southern District of the State of New York, White Plains Division, Judge Cathy Siebel presiding. It asserts that New York's ""proper cause"" requirement constitutes an unreasonable infringement upon the Second Amendment rights of the Plaintiffs and of all residents of the State of New York, subject to liability under 42 USC §1983. It requests an order enjoining the Defendants and their officers and agents from enforcing the good cause requirement of NYPC §400.00(2)(f), an order commanding Defendants to issue the Plaintiffs their applied-for permits, and other relief.          The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, and a hearing for the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgement was subsequently granted. Both sides filed numerous briefs in support or opposition to this motion, and on September 2, 2011, District Judge Cathy Siebel denied the Plaintiffs' motion, simultaneously granting the Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgement in their favor. Judge Siebel found that, in applying intermediate scrutiny, the ""good cause"" requirement promotes and is substantially related to the government's strong interest in public safety and crime prevention, and thus, while it is conceded to be an infringement of the Plaintiffs' Constitutional rights, it is constitutional and may stand. All other individual and fundamental Rights are subjected to a ""Strict Scrutiny"" standard for review which the Judge ignored. ""The relationship between the Bill of Rights and the States must be governed by a single neutral principle,"" and not in a ""watered-down, subjective version of the INDIVIDUAL guarantees of the Bill of Rights,"" (emphasis added) discussed in McDonald vs. City of Chicago (2010). The Judge has ignored the Bill of Rights and has knowingly and officially infringed not only on Plaintiff's guaranteed Right ""...to keep and bear arms,"" for self-protection but Plaintiff's Rights to Due process of Law by misapplying the Standard of Scrutiny for review.          The Plaintiffs' filed notice of an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, on September 7, 2011. Oral arguments were heard on August 22, 2012, and on November 27 of the same year, the panel ruling affirmed the District Court decision along similar reasoning. The Court noted that restrictions on firearms in New York law predate the ratification of the Constitution, and the law in nearly its current form has survived constitutional scrutiny before, albeit under the now-erroneous assertion that the Second Amendment of the Constitution is solely a check on Federal powers and does not apply to the States. New York State has an Analogue that states that, in part ""...the right to keep and bear arms CANNOT (emphasis added for clarity) be INFRINGED,"" and the Court of Appeals affirmed an error; the correct Standard of Review is the ""Strict Scrutiny"" model, which is applied in all other ""individual"" and ""fundamental"" rights, and the 2d Circuit has violated the Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees in the recently-incorporated 2d and 14th Amendments, see, McDonald vs. City of Chicago (2010). The Courts are ignoring Our Rights for ""self-defense"" in the Nation's largest city and its suburbs as the ""...right to self-defense is a central component of the 2nd Amendment,"" as described in McDonald, supra., upholding Heller vs. District of Colombia (2008).           The Appellants' (Kachalsky et alii) petition for ""certiorari"" was filed on January 8, 2013. The questions presented were:          Certiorari was denied April 15, 2013, however it is expected that the SCOTUS will hear a case like it, as the Circuit Courts are divided in their opinions on the issue of public handgun carry permit policies. ""Woollard v. Sheridan"", initially decided in favor of a plaintiff seeking to renew a Maryland CCW permit, was overturned on appeal by the Fourth Circuit along similar reasoning as the Second Circuit's here, while ""Moore v. Madigan"", a case challenging Illinois' no-issue permitting policy, was decided in favor of the Plaintiffs and subsequently upheld by the Seventh Circuit. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously used ""Intermediate Scrutiny"" instead of the correct ""Strict Scrutiny"" standards of review, necessary to protect all lawful Americans' rights of self-defense by use and carriage of guns to protect themselves from criminals and others who may do them harm, or hurt or kill their families or neighbors. UPDATE: The 4th Circuit has recognized their error in the improper use of scrutiny and REMANDED the case to the District Court with instruction to use ""Strict Scrutiny"" of their decision. This was a 3-Judge Panel Order to which the District Court asked for an en-banc ruling by the Appellate Court, which was GRANTED. The Full Court will hear the case in May, 2016.",['United States Second Amendment case law']

The pub was known as the Barley Mow until it changed its name in 1993. It is the only public house in Monmouth located beside a river. The pub has a restaurant area, seated balcony and a function room.          The building was established as a public house by 1812, when a women's friendly society met in the building once a month. The women paid small amounts into a fund which they then withdrew in times of being unable to work due to childbirth, sickness, accidents or old age.          In 1822, William Jones became the licensee of the house ""known as the Barley Mow"", and from that point on he and his family ran the pub until the last quarter of the 19th century. In 1887 the Loyal Trafalgar Lodge of Druids Friendly Society had their Jubilee Dinner at the Barley Mow with over 100 guests, at which point Mr Teague was the landlord. Later licensees included the Wakin, Stead, and Harley families. By 1939, Ind Coope & Allsopp supplied Burton Ales to the pub; this continued until the late 20th century.          Originally a row of three cottages stood between Monnow Bridge and the Barley Mow, but these were demolished in the 1950s. Heather Hurley, in her book ""The Pubs of Monmouth, Chepstow and The Wye Valley"", thought that these three cottages may have been the site of a former pub called The Dolphin between 1721 and 1858.

10239817,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10239817,Fondaco dei Tedeschi,"The Fondaco dei Tedeschi (Venetian: ""Fontego dei Tedeschi"") is a historic building in Venice, northern Italy, situated on the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge. It was the headquarters and restricted living quarters of the city's German merchants. A contemporary definition was taken of the term German which included what would today be regarded as separate nationalities.          First constructed in 1228, the building was rebuilt between 1505 and 1508, after its destruction in a fire. The reconstruction produced a very functional 4-floor building which surrounds a grand inner courtyard.           Its architecture is typical of the Italian Renaissance style.          Like the Fondaco dei Turchi, the Fondaco dei Tedeschi combined the functions of a palace, warehouse, market and restricted living quarters for its population, in this case mainly Germanic merchants from cities such as Nuremberg, Judenburg and Augsburg.          The ground floor was accessible by water and was used for storage, the first floor was dedicated to offices and an upper area contained about 160 living quarters.           The German merchants arrived shortly after the building was originally constructed in the 13th century and stayed until the Napoleonic occupation. It was one of the city's most powerful colonies of merchants, and consequently the fondaco became an important trading centre for goods passing from the Orient on their way towards the Alps. The Venetian Republic took commission on the transactions of the fondaco.          The German community worshipped at a nearby Catholic church, San Bartolomeo.          In the 20th century the building served as the Venice headquarters of the Poste Italiane. In 2008, the building was sold to the Benetton Group who asked the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to plan a new shopping centre to be incorporated into the Renaissance building. Benetton promised to transfer 6 million Euro to the city budget in exchange for building permits handed over by the end of 2012. This caused protests among the groups campaigning for preservation of the Italy's historical heritage.          The ""fondaco"" (a word of Arabic origin meaning ""store-house"") has a square plan and has three levels facing a central courtyard. The courtyard contains a medieval well and is currently covered by a steel-glass structure. The façade has, at the lower floor, five large rounded arcades which enclose a portico where once the goods were unloaded from the Canal Grande. The second floor has a long row of double and single mullioned windows which, at the upper floors, are paired by smaller quadrangular windows. The top of the façade has merlons.          Around 1508, the façade on the Canal Grande was frescoed by Giorgione and Titian. Of that work, deteriorated by the salty and humid climate of the lagoon, a few fragments survive, now housed in the Ca'D'Oro of Venice.          The interior also features outstanding artworks by Paolo Veronese, Titian and Jacopo Tintoretto, also mostly disappeared.","['Houses completed in 1508', 'Palaces in Venice', 'Renaissance architecture in Venice']"

Other kingdoms in this group include Chedi Kingdom, Dasarna Kingdom, Surasena Kingdom or Vraja Kingdom, Karusha Kingdom, Kunti Kingdom, Avanti Kingdom, Malava Kingdom, Gurjara Kingdom, Anarta Kingdom, Dwaraka Kingdom, Heheya Kingdom and Vidarbha Kingdom.          It is roughly the southern Gujarat including the peninsular region. The name Surat, a modern city of Gujarat, is derived from the name Saurashtra.          The peninsular region forming the southern Gujarat is still known as Saurashtra.          Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 30: And next turning his forces against the Paurava kingdom, Sahadeva vanquished and reduced to subjection the monarch thereof. And the prince, after this, with great efforts brought Akriti, the princess of Saurashtra and official message girl of the Kausikas under his sway. The virtuous princess, while staying in the kingdom of Saurashtra sent an amiguously flamboyant ambassador unto king Rukmin of Bhishmaka within the territories of Bhojakata.          Mahabharata, Book 8, Chapter 45: ""Karna, when angry with Shalya, rebukes him and those who have cultural similarity with his race.""          The Pancalas observe the duties enjoined in the Vedas; the Kauravas observe truth; the Matsyas and the Surasenas perform sacrifices, the Easterners follow the practices of the Shudras; the Southerners are fallen; the Vahikas are thieves.          Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 88: I shall now, O Yudhishthira, describe the sacred spots, and asylums, and rivers and lakes belonging to the Surashtra country! O Yudhishthira, on the sea-coast is the Chamasodbheda, and also Prabhasa, that tirtha which is much regarded by the Gods. There also is the tirtha called Pindaraka, frequented by ascetics. In that region is a mighty hill named Ujjayanta which conduceth to speedy success. Regarding it the celestial Rishi Narada hath recited an ancient sloka. By performing austerities on the sacred hill of Ujjayanta in Surashtra, that abounds in birds and animals, a person becometh regarded in heaven. There also is Dwaravati, producing great merit, where dwelleth the illustrious Vasudeva Krishna.          Mahabharata, Book 5, Chapter 74: Even as, when Dharma became extinct, Kali was born in the race of Asuras flourishing with prosperity and blazing with energy, so was born Udavarta among the Haihayas. Janamejaya among the Nepas, Vahula among the Talajanghas, proud Vasu among the Krimis, Ajavindu among the Suviras, Rushardhik among the Surashtras, Arkaja among the Valihas, Dhautamulaka among the Chinas, Hayagriva among the Videhas, Varayu among the Mahaujasas, Vahu among the Sundaras, Pururavas among the Diptakshas, Sahaja among the Chedis and Matsyas, Vrishaddhaja among the Praviras, Dharana among the Chandra-batsyas, Bigahana among the Mukutas and Sama among the Nandivegas. These vile individuals spring up, at the end of each Yuga, in their respective races, for the destruction of their kinsmen.          Mahabharata, Book 6, Chapter 20: That large force which was well protected by mighty car-warriors of the Vrishni and the Bhoja races, as also by the warriors of Surashtra well-armed and well-acquainted with the uses of weapons, and which was led by Kritavarman, proceeded towards the south of the Kaurava army.          Mahabharata, Book 14, Chapter 83: Battle took place between the Arjuna and the Dravidas and Andhras and the fierce Mahishakas and the hillmen of Kolwa. Subjugating those tribes without having to accomplish any fierce feats, Arjuna proceeded to the country of the Surashtras, his footsteps guided by the horse. He repaired thence to Prabhasa. Next he proceeded to the beautiful city of Dwaravati protected by the heroes of the Vrishni race. When the beautiful sacrificial horse of the Kuru king reached Dwaravati, the Yadava youths, used force against that foremost of steeds. King Ugrasena, however, soon went out and forbade those youths from doing what they meditated.",['Yadava kingdoms']

16480957,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16480957,Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery,"The Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery was a mock tribunal organised by Violence Against Women in War-Network Japan (VAWW-NET Japan). Its purpose was to gather testimony from victims, and then to try groups and individuals for rape or sexual slavery, i.e., forcing women to sexually service Japanese soldiers.          The group met on December 8, 2000, and was adjourned on December 12, 2000.          On December 4, 2001, the groups's final statement was issued in The Hague. More than 1000 paragraphs and 200 pages long, the judgment discussed the factual findings of the Tribunal, and law applicable to the case. Not all of the accused were convicted, but the late Emperor Showa was, because, as the leader of the country, he was ultimately responsible for the sex-slave policy.          The two last paragraphs of the final judgement read as follows:          The Crimes committed against these survivors remain one of the greatest unacknowledged and unremedied injustices of the Second World War. There are no museums, no graves for the unknown ""comfort woman"", no education of future generations, and there have been no judgement days for the victims of Japan's military sexual slavery and the rampant sexual violence and brutality that characterized its aggressive war.          Accordingly, through this Judgment, this Tribunal intends to honor all the women victimized by Japan's military sexual slavery system. The Judges recognize the great fortitude and dignity of the survivors who have toiled to survive and reconstruct their shattered lives and who have faced down fear and shame to tell their stories to the world and testify before us. Many of the women who have come forward to fight for justice have died unsung heroes. While the names inscribed in history's page have been, at best, those of the men who commit the crimes or who prosecute them, rather than the women who suffer them, this Judgement bears the names of the survivors who took the stand to tell their stories, and thereby, for four days at least, put wrong on the scaffold and truth on the throne.          The tribunal was broadcast by NHK as part of a documentary on Japan's wartime sexual slavery.","['Comfort women', '2000 in Japan']"
2437143,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2437143,Khan Abdul Ghani Khan,"Ghani Khan (Pashto: غني خان) ‎ (1914–1996) was a Pashto language poet of the 20th century. He was a son of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and older brother of Khan Abdul Wali Khan.          Khan Abdul Ghani Khan was born in Hashtnagar in the then North-West Frontier Province of British India, or the modern-day village of Utmanzai in Charsadda District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. He was the son of the Red-Shirt Leader Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and older brother of Khan Abdul Wali Khan. His wife Roshan came from a Parsi family and was the daughter of Nawab Rustam Jang. He went to study at the art academy at Rabindranath Tagore’s university in Shantiniketan and developed a liking for painting and sculpture. He visited England and studied sugar technology in the United States, after which he returned to India and started working at the Takht Bhai Sugar Mills in 1933. Largely owing to his father’s influence, he was also involved in politics, supporting the cause of the Pashtuns of British India. He was arrested by the Government of Pakistan in 1948 – although he had given up politics by then – and remained in prison till 1954, in various jails all over the country. It was during these years that he wrote his poem collection ""Da Panjray Chaghaar"", which he considered the best work of his life. His contribution to literature (often unpublished) was ignored by the Pakistan government for much of his life although near the end of his life his works did receive much praise and as well as an award from the Government of Pakistan. For his contributions to Pukhto literature and painting, the President of Pakistan, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, conferred on him the prestigious award of Sitara-e-Imtiaz (23 March 1980).          Aside from a few poems of his youth and early manhood, Ghani Khan’s poetry, like his temperament, is anti-political. His poem collections include ""Panoos"", ""Palwashay"", ""De Panjray Chaghar"", ""Kullryat"" and ""Latoon"". He also wrote in English; his first book was ""The Pathans"" (1947). His only published work in Urdu was his book titled Khan Sahib (1994). with thanks and a lot of books          The singular distinction of his poetry – aside from his obvious poetic genius – is a profound blend of knowledge about his native and foreign cultures, and the psychological, sensual, and religious aspects of life.          A translation (Pashto to English) of selected 141 poems of Ghani Khan, called The Pilgrim of Beauty, has been authored by Imtiaz Ahmad Sahibzada, a friend and admirer of the poet. The book was printed in 2014 in Islamabad, Pakistan. It is a joint initiative by individual donors in Pakistan and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, Afghanistan. The book also contains paintings of Ghani Khan. The Pakistan launch of the book took place in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Pukhtun Festival,in March 2015. The Afghanistan launch took place on 22 February 2016 by the Ministry of Information and Culture.          Ghani Khan's love for nature and the local habitat of the Pashtun people is visible in his work. He wrote          After his death, in recognition of his outstanding achievements, the Government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province built a public library and park as a memorial to him on about of land, naming it ""Ghani Derai"" (the mound of Ghani). The site is an historical mound very near his home, Dar- ul-Aman, and within the confines of his ancestral village, Utmanzai, on the main highway from Razzar to Takht-i-Bhai.

She was among the first police officers to take statements from female and juvenile assault victims.          After her education at Thanet Hall, Margate, and a Paris finishing school, Wyles broke off the legal studies she had begun at her father's instigation, to serve as a hospital nurse in the First World War.          Wyles started her police career in February 1919 as one of three sergeants in the temporary women patrols, covering Central London and the East End. The patrols met with scorn from male policemen and from members of the public, ""Daunted at first, Wyles became accustomed to her visibility as another London sight, 'along with the Tower and Westminster Abbey'. People stopped and commented within earshot: 'How queer.' 'How unwomanly.' 'Not quite nice, do you think?'"" but were given tasks such as escorting lost children. When the women's patrols were disbanded, she became a pioneer in the establishment of women as officers in the Metropolitan Police in 1922. As the first woman in such a position, her relations with male colleagues were uneasy, although she enjoyed the confidence of the chief constable of the CID, Frederick Porter Wensley, until his retirement in 1929.          Wyles was instrumental in making it a task for women policemen, not of outside ""assistants"" to take statements from women in cases of sexual assault, as ""detailed knowledge of the rules of evidence was required for a statement to be both useful and admissible. In 1922 Wyles was given responsibility for the taking of statements in all cases involving children and young girls that arose north of the Thames...""(pp. 186–87)          Greater respect came in 1928, after the part she took in the Savidge case involving sexual misconduct by an Italian-born member of Parliament, Leo Chiozza Money, despite being initially spurned by Chief Inspector Alfred Collins, in charge of the case.          Wyles was promoted to chief inspector in 1932 and retired to Cornwall in 1949. There she wrote her memoirs, ""A Woman at Scotland Yard"" (London: Faber, 1952).

655340,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=655340,Blixa Bargeld,"Blixa Bargeld (born Christian Emmerich on 12 January 1959) is a German-born musician active in a wide range of artistic fields. He is best known for his studio work and live performances with the groups Einstürzende Neubauten and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. His stage name comes from ""Blixa"", a German brand of blue felt pen, and ""Bargeld"", which is German for ""cash"". Bargeld also refers to German Dada artist Johannes Theodor Baargeld.          Bargeld left school prior to completion and is self-taught. He revealed in 2010: ""[I] would never have guessed when I was 13 that I would have become a professional musician. It was so far away as to become a reality in my personal life."" Bargeld experimented with audio equipment as a teenager, including the disassembling of tape recorders.          Bargeld is from the Tempelhof area of West Berlin and he moved out of his parents' home in the late 1970s. A 2008 documentary featured him visiting his mother and talking to her about his childhood and the relationship he had with his parents.          In 1980, he founded the music group Einstürzende Neubauten (""Collapsing New Buildings""); the first album he owned was by Pink Floyd. He quickly moved onto German rock Krautrock acts such as Kraftwerk, Neu! and Can, which he described as his biggest influences at the time. Bargeld spoke of the early days of Neubauten in 2010:          The starting point for Neubauten was more that we didn't have anything, so I didn't really have the choice to say 'I am doing this, I am doing that, or maybe I should play organ'. I didn't have any of these things, and I could not afford any of these things, and neither could anybody else in the group. It was more of the logical consequence of what can we obtain, and that's how it turned out. It certainly didn't start out as an artistic concept to say ""let's do something different"", it started as an extension of the live situation as it already was.          From 1983 to 2003, Bargeld was a long-time guitarist and backing vocalist in Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Bargeld also sang lead vocals alongside Cave on several songs, such as on ""The Carny"" and ""The Weeping Song"". Cave first saw Bargeld performing with Einstürzende Neubauten on TV while The Birthday Party, Cave's band at the time, were touring in Amsterdam. He described the music as ""mournful"", Bargeld as looking ""destroyed"", and his screams as: ""a sound you would expect to hear from strangled cats or dying children"".          He is credited with playing guitar on the Gun Club song, ""Yellow Eyes"", on their 1987 album ""Mother Juno"". He also played on the album ""Novice"" by Alain Bashung in 1989.          Since the mid-90s Bargeld has appeared live with his solo ""Rede/Speech Performances"". During these performances, usually supported by Neubauten's sound engineer Boris Wilsdorf, he works with microphones, sound effects, overdubbing with the help of sampler loops, and speaks English or German. The performed pieces include a vocal creation of the DNA of an angel and a parody of a techno song.          In 2007 he started a collaborative project with Alva Noto called ANBB, an abbreviation of Noto's and Bargeld's initials. An EP, ""Ret Marut Handshake"", was released on 26 June 2010, followed later that year by a full-length album, ""Mimikry"".          In June 2013, a collaboration with Italian composer Teho Teardo ""Still Smiling"" was released on the Specula record label. A music video for the song ""Mi Scusi"" was published on the Teho Teardo YouTube channel and a corresponding Italian tour is scheduled.          In early October, Neubauten announced 24 November 2014 as the release date for their next album, ""Lament"". ""Lament"" is described as a: ""concept album based on a live performance and installation commissioned by the Flemish city of Diksmuide, Belgium to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War in 1914"". Bargeld explained in the official press release: ""The Second World War is nothing but the elongation of the first one … As a child of the post Second World War era, and the resulting division of Germany and Berlin, I’m of course hugely influenced in my upbringing about the results of that"".          Bargeld explained in October 2014 that Neubauten is essentially a materialistic band, leading them to employ two scientific researchers to seek out material to support the development of ""Lament"" after the album received financial backing in August 2013. The band opened their 2014 European tour, in support of ""Lament"", with a performance in Diksmuide, Belgium, to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War.          Jennifer Shryane, in her book ""Blixa Bargeld and Einstürzende Neubauten: German Experimental Music. Evading do-re-mi"" (2011), explores how the themes and threads of Bargeld’s work with Neubauten show even greater variation and experimentation in his performance work outside of the band. For example, the range extends from his surreal, electronic Dadaist-cabaret Rede and collaborations with Alva Noto, to his expert direction of Coetzee’s ""Warten auf die Barbaren"" (""Waiting for the Barbarians"") for the Salzburg Festival in 2005, where he employed multi-layered symbolism through an ice-white setting and an interplay of voices, screams and noise.          Shryane’s book particularly examines his vocal strategies and his trademark scream (describing the scream in dance terms as the endless pirouette or unanticipated giant leap) and the labyrinthine concerns of his texts – all through Artaudian performance theory (The Theatre and its Double, 1938). She also stresses Bargeld’s passionate stance on the socializing aspects of music (a la John Cage) citing his comment on Grundstück that: ""it’s the social aspects which are important for me"".          Bargeld's guitars of choice are a Fender Jaguar and a Fender Mustang, as seen on the concert DVD ""God Is In The House"" and at various media appearances. Initially he used a battered Höfner Model 173 and a red Höfner Colorama II until they ""broke down"". After his effect pedals were stolen in the early 1980s, he relied exclusively on the Fender floating/dynamic tremolo (like the Höfner units)— which both raise and lower pitch — Fender Twin amplifiers, metal slides, and changing his amp settings for each individual song, to create a unique guitar sound.          Bargeld is married to American Erin Zhu. Together they developed the concept of web-based fan subscriptions as a new business model for musicians. The couple is featured among 37 other design and media figures in the 2010 book ""Designing Media"", by designer and IDEO co-founder Bill Moggridge. The couple resides with their daughter in San Francisco, Beijing, and Berlin.          Bargeld was a vegetarian for 30 years, but ceased the lifestyle option due to the difficulties he had practicing vegetarianism in China. He was also a smoker for a long period, but quit smoking in the early 2000s. The sound of Bargeld smoking a cigarette is a part of Einstürzende Neubauten's song ""Silence Is Sexy"" (2000), which is featured on the ""Silence Is Sexy"" studio album.","['1959 births', 'Living people', 'Einst\xc3\xbcrzende Neubauten members', 'German experimental musicians', 'German industrial musicians', 'German rock guitarists', 'Male guitarists', 'German spoken word artists', 'Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds members', 'Noise musicians', 'San Francisco Art Institute faculty']"

45267284,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45267284,Treehouse of Horror XXVI,"""Treehouse of Horror XXVI"" is the fifth episode of the twenty-seventh season of the animated television series ""The Simpsons"", the 26th episode in the ""Treehouse of Horror"" series of Halloween specials, and the 579th episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on October 25, 2015.          The episode, like the other ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes, comprises three self-contained segments. In ""Wanted: Dead, Then Alive"", Sideshow Bob finally murders Bart; in ""Homerzilla"", Homer plays the role of Godzilla and his American remake; and in ""Telepaths of Glory"", Lisa, Milhouse and Maggie receive telepathic powers. Showrunner Al Jean gave an interview about the episode in the month before it aired. Kelsey Grammer reprises his role as the guest voice of Sideshow Bob, and the opening musical sequence was animated by John Kricfalusi.          ""Treehouse of Horror XXVI"" was watched by an audience of 6.75 million, the highest on Fox that night. Reception was mixed, with its perceived excess violence and lack of originality being criticized.          The episode opens with a John Kricfalusi-animated couch gag where the Simpson children are trick-or-treating before being set upon by soul-hungry spirits with a monstrous Frank Grimes among them. The spirits chase after the Simpson children to their home, and the Frank Grimes monster skins Bart and takes Homer's soul.          Bart gets a text message from Milhouse, telling him to come to the music room. When he gets there, he finds Sideshow Bob, who lured him there with Milhouse's phone in order to accomplish his lifelong dream: to kill Bart. Bob kills Bart with a spear gun and takes his body to his house to celebrate his accomplishment. As his main objective in life is done, he decides to complete other dreams, such as becoming a literature teacher at Springfield University, but is dissatisfied as his students are lazy cheaters. He discovers that the only thing that has made him happy was hunting down Bart for 24 years, so he builds a machine to bring Bart back to life so he can kill him over and over. Bob's machine is discovered by Santa's Little Helper, and the Simpson family break into his basement and reanimate Bart. Bob appears with a shotgun and has the legal right to kill the intruding Simpsons. Homer attacks Bob with a lamp, ripping his head off, and Marge decides that Bart can keep Bob's remains. Bart puts Bob's head into the Reanimator with a horn, frog legs, a chicken body, a tail and a booger, making a bizarre-looking creature.          In a parody of Godzilla, a crazy old Japanese man based on Grampa Simpson is constantly mocked because every day he drops a perfect donut into the ocean. When asked why he does such things, he says that is because if he does not, a huge sea monster will rise and destroy the city. One day, as he is preparing a donut for his ""ritual"", he chokes on the toppings and dies. With nobody to drop the donuts, a sea monster called Homerzilla (Homer) wakes up and destroys the city. The scene cuts to the present time, where executives are watching the ""Homerzilla"" film, stating that it is so bad that it deserves a remake. Two years later, they release ""Zilla"", a total failure. They throw all the merchandising into the ocean, but the containers wake up Homerzilla and a message appears reporting that he will return as soon as people have forgotten about the last film.          In a parody of ""Chronicle"", Bart, Lisa and Milhouse are walking through a forest. Bart scares Lisa with dead owls, and she hits Milhouse's nose with the camera, making him lose his balance and fall into a giant hole. Bart and Lisa decide to jump into the hole to rescue him, making all the three stuck inside of it with nuclear waste from the nuclear power plant. The radioactive goo explodes, sending all three of them back outside the hole. When they wake up, Milhouse and Lisa discover that they have gained telekinesis, so they decide to use the powers on their favor. Lisa only makes a few changes, but Milhouse goes mad with powers only to be struck by lightning. Lisa says she did not do it, making the family curious to discover who did this. They then realize that Maggie also has telepathic powers, as she was using a radioactive rod as a pacifier. Maggie then uses her powers to benefit the world, such as turning Homerzilla into a larger Barney the Dinosaur before taking a nap. The episode ends with Kang and Kodos complaining that once again, they only have made a cameo appearance.          In a September 2015, interview with ""The Hollywood Reporter"", Al Jean spoke about the episode, saying: ""We're trying to break barriers and it's like nothing we've ever done. It's a bit of a very scary tribute to Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but updated. Then we have Sideshow Bob killing Bart. And if you wanted Bob to kill Bart, you're going to get your wish. I was always the kind of kid that wanted [Wile E.] Coyote to eat the Roadrunner, so this made me very happy"". He added that Bob's voice actor, Kelsey Grammer, was excited by the prospect, exclaiming ""Oh, finally!""          The episode opens with a sequence animated by ""Ren & Stimpy"" creator John Kricfalusi, featuring a """"Grinch""-esque song"" which ""sneaks in Kricfalusi’s signature scatology while being quite catchy"". Bob chastises his students for using Wikipedia for their research on T. S. Eliot, lamenting that ""the author of ""Cats"" could be insulted further"". Elvis Costello's 1979 single ""Accidents Will Happen"" plays as Bob repeatedly murders Bart.          The episode received a 2.8 rating and was watched by a total of 6.75 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night.          The episode received mixed reviews. Dennis Perkins of ""The A.V. Club"" gave the episode a B-, calling it ""middling"". He wrote that the first segment ""just goes for the gore"" and that there was ""not much glee in the dark humor""; though he did praise Bart's death montage and compared it to those of ""Emperor Joker"" and its """" adaptation, he concluded that the segment ""is as repetitive as murdering your arch-enemy again and again and again."" He was more favoring towards the satire in ""Homerzilla"", but concluded that it had ""not too much meat on [its] bones"", and decried the lack of originality in the final segment, although he approved of Principal Skinner correcting graffiti to call himself a ""wiener"". Perkins compared the episode negatively against its predecessor, ""Halloween of Horror"".          Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode 6.9 out of 10, saying that it ""offers a decent lineup of darker Springfield adventures. The standout is the return of Sideshow Bob, a story entertaining enough it really deserved its own, full-length episode. ""Homerzilla"" also has its moments. And while the lack of originality in ""Telepaths of Glory"" is disappointing, as a whole this episode is entertaining enough to fall comfortably in the middle of the pack as far as ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes go.""","['2015 television episodes', 'Halloween television episodes', 'The Simpsons (season 27) episodes', 'Treehouse of Horror (series)', 'Godzilla', 'Telepathy in fiction']"

514028,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=514028,Hafele–Keating experiment,"The Hafele–Keating experiment was a test of the theory of relativity. In October 1971, Joseph C. Hafele, a physicist, and Richard E. Keating, an astronomer, took four cesium-beam atomic clocks aboard commercial airliners. They flew twice around the world, first eastward, then westward, and compared the clocks against others that remained at the United States Naval Observatory. When reunited, the three sets of clocks were found to disagree with one another, and their differences were consistent with the predictions of special and general relativity.          According to special relativity, the rate of a clock is greatest according to an observer who is at rest with respect to the clock. In a frame of reference in which the clock is not at rest, the clock runs more slowly, as expressed by the Lorentz factor. This effect, called time dilation, has been confirmed in many tests of special relativity, such as the Ives–Stilwell experiment and time dilation of moving particles. Considering the Hafele–Keating experiment in a frame of reference at rest with respect to the center of the earth, a clock aboard the plane moving eastward, in the direction of the Earth's rotation, had a greater velocity (resulting in a relative time loss) than one that remained on the ground, while a clock aboard the plane moving westward, against the Earth's rotation, had a lower velocity than one on the ground.          General relativity predicts an additional effect, in which an increase in gravitational potential due to altitude speeds the clocks up. That is, clocks at higher altitude tick faster than clocks on Earth's surface. This effect has been confirmed in many tests of general relativity, such as the Pound–Rebka experiment and Gravity Probe A. In the Hafele–Keating experiment, there was a slight increase in gravitational potential due to altitude that tended to speed the clocks back up. Since the aircraft flew at roughly the same altitude in both directions, this effect was approximately the same for the two planes, but nevertheless it caused a difference in comparison to the clocks on the ground.          The results were published in ""Science"" in 1972:          The published outcome of the experiment was consistent with special and general relativity. The observed time gains and losses were different from zero to a high degree of confidence, and were in agreement with relativistic predictions to within the ~10% precision of the experiment.          A more complex and precise experiment of this kind was performed by a research group at the University of Maryland between September 1975 and January 1976. Three atomic clocks were brought to an altitude of 10 km above Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, and three other atomic clocks were at the ground. A turboprop plane was used, flying at only 500 km/h, in order to minimize the velocity effect. The plane was steadily observed using radar, and its position and velocity were measured every second. Five flights were carried out, each of 15 hours duration. Special containers protected the clocks from external influences such as vibrations, magnetic fields, or temperature variations. The time difference was measured by direct clock comparison at the ground before and after the flight, as well as during the flight by laser pulses of 0.1 ns duration. Those signals were sent to the plane, reflected, and again received at the ground station. The time difference was observable during the flight, before later analysis. An overall difference of 47.1 ns was measured, which consisted of the velocity effect of -5.7 ns and a gravitational effect of 52.8 ns. This agrees with the relativistic predictions to a precision of about 1.6%.          A reenactment of the original experiment by the National Physical Laboratory took place in 1996 on the 25th anniversary of the original experiment, using more precise atomic clocks during a flight from London to Washington, D.C. and back again. The results were verified to a higher degree of accuracy. A time gain of 39 ± 2 ns was observed, compared to a relativistic prediction of 39.8 ns. In June 2010, the National Physical Laboratory again repeated the experiment, this time around the globe (London - Los Angeles - Auckland - Hongkong - London). The predicted value was 246 ± 3 ns, the measured value 230 ± 20 ns.          Because the Hafele–Keating experiment has been reproduced by increasingly accurate methods, there has been a consensus among physicists since at least the 1970s that the relativistic predictions of gravitational and kinematic effects on time have been conclusively verified. Criticisms of the experiment did not address the subsequent verification of the result by more accurate methods, and have been shown to be in error.          Measurements in which the only effect was gravitational have been conducted by Iijima et al. between 1975 and 1977. They carried a commercial cesium clock back and forth from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Mitaka, at above sea level, to Norikura corona station, at above sea level, corresponding to an altitude difference of . During the times when the clock stayed at Mitaka, it was compared with another cesium clock. The measured change in rate was (29±1.5)×10, consistent with the result of 30.7×10 predicted by general relativity.          In 1976, Briatore and Leschiutta compared the rates of two cesium clocks, one in Turin above sea level, the other at Plateau Rosa above sea level. The comparison was conducted by evaluating the arrival times of VHF television synchronization pulses and of a LORAN-C chain. The predicted difference was 30.6 ns/d. Using two different operating criteria, they found differences of 33.8±6.8 ns/d and 36.5±5.8 ns/d, respectively, in agreement with general relativity. Environmental factors were controlled far more precisely than in the Iijima experiment, in which many complicated corrections had to be applied.          In 2010, Chou ""et al"". performed tests in which both gravitational and velocity effects were measured at velocities and gravitational potentials much smaller than those used in the mountain-valley experiments of the 1970s. It was possible to confirm velocity time dilation at the 10 level at speeds below 36 km/h. Also, gravitational time dilation was measured from a difference in elevation between two clocks of only .          Nowadays both gravitational and velocity effects are, for example, routinely incorporated into the calculations used for the Global Positioning System.          In his original 1905 paper on special relativity, Einstein suggested a possible test of the theory: ""Thence we conclude that a spring-clock at the equator must go more slowly, by a very small amount, than a precisely similar clock situated at one of the poles under otherwise identical conditions."" Because he had not yet developed the general theory, he did not realize that the results of such a test would in fact be null, since the surface of the earth is a gravitational equipotential, and therefore the effects of kinematic and gravitational time dilation would precisely cancel. The kinematic effect was verified in the 1938 Ives–Stilwell experiment and in the 1940 Rossi-Hall experiment. General relativity's prediction of the gravitational effect was confirmed in 1959 by Pound and Rebka. These experiments, however, used subatomic particles, and were therefore less direct than the type of measurement with actual clocks as originally envisioned by Einstein.          Hafele, an assistant professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis, was preparing notes for a physics lecture when he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation showing that an atomic clock aboard a commercial airliner should have sufficient precision to detect the predicted relativistic effects. He spent a year in fruitless attempts to get funding for such an experiment, until he was approached after a talk on the topic by Keating, an astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory who worked with atomic clocks.          Hafele and Keating obtained $8000 in funding from the Office of Naval Research for one of the most inexpensive tests ever conducted of general relativity. Of this amount, $7600 was spent on the eight round-the-world plane tickets, including two seats on each flight for ""Mr. Clock."" They flew eastward around the world, ran the clocks side by side for a week, and then flew westward. The crew of each flight helped by supplying the navigational data needed for the comparison with theory. In addition to the scientific papers published in Science, there were several accounts published in the popular press and other publications, including one with a photo showing a stewardess ironically checking her wristwatch while standing behind the instruments.","['Tests of general relativity', 'Tests of special relativity', 'Albert Einstein', '1971 in science']"
