a) Familiarize yourself with the usage of man-pages:

$ man man
>MAN(1)                        Manual pager utils                        MAN(1)
>
>NAME
>       man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals
>
>SYNOPSIS
>       ...
>
>DESCRIPTION
>       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to  man  is
>       normally  the  name of a program, utility or function.
>
>The program 'man' offers you some instruction for an other program, utility or function.

b) Print your current working directory:

$ man pwd
>/home/burgemeister

c) Show all files in your home directory:

# all visible files/directories
$ls
>exercise_01

# all files (listed)
$ls -al
>total 105
>drwx------   6 burgemeister bd-1718   12 Oct 25 22:14 .
>drwxr-xr-x 545 root         root     546 Oct 25 21:21 ..
>-rw-------   1 burgemeister bd-1718  145 Oct 25 11:51 .bash_history
>-rw-------   1 burgemeister bd-1718  220 Oct 24 14:55 .bash_logout
>-rw-------   1 burgemeister bd-1718 3943 Oct 24 14:55 .bashrc
>drwx------   2 burgemeister bd-1718    3 Oct 24 14:55 .cache
>drwxr-xr-x   2 burgemeister bd-1718    2 Oct 24 14:57 exercise_01
>-rw-------   1 burgemeister bd-1718 2181 Oct 24 14:55 .kshrc
>-rw-------   1 burgemeister bd-1718  655 Oct 24 14:55 .profile
>drwxr-xr-x   3 burgemeister bd-1718    3 Oct 24 14:55 .spack
>drwx------   2 burgemeister bd-1718    6 Oct 24 14:56 .ssh
>-rw-------   1 burgemeister bd-1718  200 Oct 25 22:14 .Xauthority

d) Create a directory named testdir

$mkdir

e) Change your working directory to the newly created one

$ cd testdir

f) Output the current working directory once more.

$ls
>exercise_01 testdir

g) Create an empty file named testfile

$touch testfile

Touch change file timestamps. If the file does not exist, an empty file is supplied.

h) Rename the file to testfile2

$ mv testfile testfile2

The program 'mv' moves the file to the new path, for this reason it's renamed.

i) Copy the renamed file to testfile3

$ cp testfile2 testfile3

This command copies the source file to the final file.

j) Delete the file testfile2

$ rm testfile2

self-explanatory...

QUESTION: Why is the manual page cd titled ”POSIX Programmer’s Manual” whereas other manual
pages have the title ”User Commands” ? (hint: Study the cd manual-page in detail.)

There is no manual-page for the command cd, because cd is a builtin shell command. These builtin commands are part
of the shell and are implemented as part of the shell's source code. The shell recognizes that the command that it was
asked to execute was one of its builtins. It performs that action on its own without calling out to a separate
executable.
